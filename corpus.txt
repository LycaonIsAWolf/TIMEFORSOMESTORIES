EVERY GODDAMNED CHRISTMAS MY DAD AND MY UNCLE RON GET INTO IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS ABOUT POLITICS AND THE BEST AIRPORTS IN ZURICH AND WHICH PRESIDENTS ARE ASSHOLES IN PERSON AND THAT SORT OF THING. MY OTHER UNCLE D. IS KIND OF THE BLACK SHEEP IN THE FAMILY AND WE DON'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO HIM.
ANYWAY THIS ONE CHRISTMAS MY DAD & RON ARE REALLY GOING AT IT, SOMETHING ABOUT AFRICA, WHEN UNCLE D. WALKS INTO THE MIDDLE OF THINGS GINGERLY CARRYING THIS TAPE LIKE IT WAS A DYING CHILD AND LOOKS COYLY AT MY DAD AND RON AND SAYS "SO, I BET YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT SONG IS THIS!!"
AND MY DAD AND RON COULDN'T CARE LESS AND SOMEONE SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THERE'S NO TIME BUT UNCLE D. IS ALREADY BREAKING THE TAPE DECK AND JAMMING IN HIS PRECIOUS TAPE. HE FLASHES US A SLY LOOK AND SAYS "I BET NOBODY HERE WILL GET THIS" AND PRESSES PLAY
IT'S FUCKING 'HEY JUDE'. 19 PEOPLE IN THE LIVING ROOM ALL SAY 'IT'S HEY JUDE' AT THE SAME TIME AND LOOK AGGRAVATED.
UNCLE D. LOOKS AT US ALL IMPISHLY AND SAYS 'NO'. 
I'M PASTING THIS FROM THE SMALL TALK THREAD BECAUSE IT SHOULD GO HERE:
ALSO A PRETTY SWEET STORY AT SCHOOL INVOLVING THE WORD 'CARROT'
WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT WEBER AND MY RUSSIAN TEACHER HAS AN ACCENT AS THICK AS MY CLASSMATES AND IS GOING ON ABOUT HOW SCIENCE CAN ACTUALLY PROVE SOMETHING WHEREAS ENGLISH OR ARCHITECTURE CANNOT. 
SOME INBRED URCHIN IN THE FRONT ROW SLAMS HIS BIG HAMMY FIST ON THE DESK AND DEMANDS CLARITY.
MY RUSSIAN TEACHER GIVES HIM A STERN LOOK AND SAYS "SCIENCE CAN PROVE ZINGS ZEE GREEN GROZER CANNOT!"
IDIOT BRIGADE IN THE FRONT STILL DOESN'T GET IT. "GREEN GROZAY?"
"GREEN GROZER! GREEN GROZER!" MY TEACHER EXCLAIMS EXCITEDLY
"GREEN GROZAY? WHAT'S GREEN GROZAY?!" 
"GREEN GROZER! GREEN GROZER!! HE SELLS THE GREEN GROZERIES!!" TEACHER RETORTS
"OH!!" A SMALL LIGHT GOES ON SOMEWHERE WITHIN THAT MISERABLE CAITIFF. "THE GREEN GROWER!" HE SMILES BROADLY.
THEN, THEN, AS IF THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH, SOME WRETCH OF A GIRL DOWN THE ROW JUMPS UP FROM HER SEAT LIKE SHE WAS BITTEN AND SAYS IN THIS POSITIVELY AGHAST VOICE "BUT CARROTS ARE RED!!!" 
SO I'M ON THE BUS FOR SOME GODDAMNED REASON AND I AM LISTENING CAREFULLY TO THE CONVERSATION IN FRONT OF ME, HELD BETWEEN THIS BLOWSY SULKY GIRL WHO IS CLEARLY DOMINATING THE SITUATION AND HER 'BOYFRIEND', A SCRAWNY LOOKING MESS NEAR TEARS. THE FOLLOWING IS ALMOST VERBATIM.
SCRAWNY MESS: WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'VE CHEATED ON ME?!
BLOWSY GIRL: I CHEATED ON YOU.
SCRAWNY MESS: (SNIFFLING MISERABLY) BUT.. BUT.. YOU CHEATED ON ME?
BLOWSY GIRL: (ALMOST INDIGNANTLY) YES.
SCRAWNY MESS: (TEARS FORMING) FOR HOW LONG?
BLOWSY GIRL: (WITH A HINT OF SATISFACTION) ABOUT A YEAR.
SCRAWNY MESS: (TEARS WELLING UP) OHHHHH NOOOO. 
SCRAWNY MESS PAUSES TO REFLECT. THE BOY IS A VERITABLE DISTILLERY AT THIS POINT AND YOU CAN JUST TELL SOME SORT OF ULTIMATUM IS COMING. HE MASTERS HIS EMOTIONS AND BECOMES VERY STILL. I AM EXPECTING HIM TO GET ALL KUNG FU ON THIS GIRL. INSTEAD HE TURNS TO HER, WIPES THE TEARS FROM HIS EYES AND SAYS "STRIKE ONE, NANCY... STRIKE ONE." 
I ALSO POSTED THIS IN THE SMALL TALK THREAD BUT IT SHOULD GO HERE:
SO IT'S CHRISTMAS AND MY FAMILY IS PLAYING 'SCATTERGORIES' AND EVERYONE IS DRUNK, ESPECIALLY MY STEP-UNCLE RICK. HE'S JUST RAVING DRUNK. IT'S CRAZY. SOMEONE ROLLS THE LETTER 'F' AND WE ALL SPEND 2 MINUTES TRYING TO FILL OUT THE BLANKS. THE TIMER DINGS AND WE GO AROUND TELLING EACH OTHER OUR ANSWERS.
THE FIRST CATEGORY IS 'VEGETABLE'. WE ALL GO AROUND AND WE GET TO DRUNK STEP-UNCLE RICK WHO LOOKS AT US ALL SMUGLY, DIGS UP THIS WIDE GRIN, AND THEN SAYS "FUCKING CARROTS!! BAHABDIUAGHF(*PA#HIOH BHAHAH AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" AND LAUGHS LIKE A GODDAMNED DEMON KING FOR NEARLY A FULL MINUTE. ONCE HE'S SETTLED DOWN WE MOVE ON. THE NEXT CATEGORY IS 'THINGS YOU FIND ON THE BEACH' OR SOMETHING, AND WHEN WE GET TO RICK AGAIN WE ARE GIVEN THIS CONSPIRATORIAL WINK AND NOD, AND THEN HE SCREAMS OUT "FUCKING TOWELS, MAN!!! BBAHAHAHAHHAHA UAHDIUAHIUHAIUH AHAHAHAHAHA" AND AGAIN WE ARE UNNERVED BY HIS CRAZED LUNATIC LAUGHTER.
THIS GOES ON FOR SEVERAL ROUNDS! IT GETS TIRED REALLY QUICKLY! FINALLY, AROUND ROUND 7 OR 8 WE GET TO THE CATEGORY 'OCCUPATION'. WE GO AROUND AND GIVE EACH OTHER LOOKS OF DREAD AS DRUNK RICK'S TURN APPROACHES. FINALLY IT'S HIS TURN. WE BRACE OURSELVES FOR THE INEVITABLE 'FUCKING DOCTOR, MAN!!' OR 'FUCKING BUS DRIVER SHIT YEAH!!'. THE TENSION IS TERRIFIC. DRUNK STEP-UNCLE RICK CLEARS HIS THROAT, SHOOTS US A MANIACLE LOOK, AND THEN SAYS QUIETLY AND CALMY 'forensic scientist' AND THEN GIVES A CALM NOD TO THE PERSON ON HIS LEFT.
HE THEN GETS UP, WALKS INTO THE KITCHEN, AND FALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT AND PASSES OUT. 
SO WE'RE IN KANSAS CITY ON TOUR AND I CALL MY MOM AND I'M LIKE "MOM I'M IN WICHITA, THIS IS WHERE YOU GREW UP!!" AND MY MOM'S LIKE "YEAH IT'S NICE ISN'T IT? TALK TO THE PEOPLE, THEY'RE REALLY FRIENDLY!"
SO THEN I GO TO THE DOLLAR STORE TO SEE IF I CAN SCORE SOME FOOD BECAUSE I'M ON TOUR AND THEREFORE POOR AS ALL HELL AND I WITNESS THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION BETWEEN THIS LARGE, LAZY MAN OPERATING THE CASH REGISTER, AND THIS SHRIVELLED, WITHERED HUSK OF AN WOMAN, WHO IS SCREECHING AT EVERYONE WITHIN EARSHOT. SHE TURNS THE BRUNT OF HER FORCE ONTO THE IMMOVABLE LAZY MAN. 
"I WANT TO BUY THREE CANS OF THIS TOMATO SAUCE BUT THERE'S ONLY ONE HERE. CHECK IN THE BACK!"
THE IMMOBILE MAN LOOKS UTTERLY BORED. "I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY IN THE BACK."
THE SHRILL OCTOGENARIAN DOESN'T SKIP A BEAT: "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "THINK". GO CHECK! GO CHECK!"
THE LAZY LARGE MAN CASTS HER A GLANCE OF SLIGHT REPROVE: "I AIN'T CHECKIN'."
THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR OUR ANTAGONIST, OR POSSIBLY PROTAGONIST. SHE CLEARS HER THROAT AND SHRIEKS LIKE A BANSHEE: "WHAT IF I WANTED TO BUY A HUNDRED CANS!!!!!!!1"
THE LARGE MAN LOOKS AT THE WOMAN DISDAINFULLY AND SAYS WITH THE FIRST HINT OF A SOUTHERN ACCENT "WELL AH KNOW WE DON'T GOT A HUNDRED CANS IN THE BACK!" 
SO JENN AND I ARE DRIVING THROUGH MICHIGAN WHICH IS KIND OF A DREARY STATE AND WE STOP IN SOME SMALL VILLAGE OR POSSIBLY BOOM TOWN WHO KNOWS AND LOOK FOR FOOD. THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL I'M GOING TO FIND ANYTHING VEGAN SO I THROW IN THE TOWEL AND GET PREPARED TO EAT A SWEET GLASS OF WATER AND MAYBE A SALAD IF I'M LUCKY. WE GO TO THE NEAREST PLACE, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THIS COMPLETELY RAMSHACKLED HUT. THERE IS THICK BLACK SMOKE POURING OUT OF A HOLE IN THE CORRUGATED IRON ROOF AND SWEARS COMING FROM INSIDE. A LARGE SIGN ADVERTISING A 60 OUNCE STEAK IS PEELING FROM ABOVE THE DOOR. THERE IS SOME SORT OF GREASE POOLING NEAR MY FEET. THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ADVENTURE!
SO JENN AND I WALK IN AND IT'S WORSE THAN I THOUGHT. WHAT I ASSUME TO BE A CONVICTED FELON IS STANDING BEHIND THE BAR, YELLING OBSCENITIES AT THE COOK IN THE BACK, AN EQUALLY REPREHENSIBLE OAF WHOSE OUTRAGEOUSLY LONG MULLET IS SWEEPING OVER ALL THE FOOD. 
I STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND TRY MY HAND AT CONVERSATION. "DO YOU HAVE A MENU?"
"NO MENU."
I SWING AGAIN "OKAY, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT ISN'T MEAT?"
THIS TIME THE COOK IN THE BACK TURNS A BEERY EYE ON ME. "WHAT DOES THAT KID WANT?"
"HE WANTS TO KNOW IF WE HAVE ANYTHING THAT ISN'T MEAT"
THE COOK TURNS TO ME "YEAH OF COURSE! WE HAVE FAUX-TURKEY AND MOCK CHICKEN, AND WE ALSO HAVE TOFU SCRAMBLER!"
THIS KNOCKS ME FOR A LOOP. TURNS OUT THIS PLACE HAS A TON OF VEGAN SHIT. JENN & I ORDER A BUNCH OF FOOD TO GO. AS I WALK OUT OF THE BUILDING THE COOK SHOUTS OUT AFTER ME "DON'T FORGET YOU CAN ORDER FROM US ONLINE!!!" 
SO I'M HANGING OUT IN THE BASEMENT READING AND MY DAD COMES DOWNSTAIRS AND HE LOOKS AT ME AND HE SAYS "DANGER POINT!! YOU LEFT THE OVEN ON!" AND I'M ALL LIKE "DANGER POINT?" 
RIGHT SO IT'S KINDERGARTEN AND IT'S SPRING AND EVERYTHING IS THAWING AND MUDDY. AND ALL THE KIDS HAVE THOSE RUBBER BOOTS THAT GO UP TO OUR WAISTS. THE THING TO DO IN THE MORNING BEFORE CLASS STARTS IS TO FIND A BUDDY, GO FIND A NICE SOFT MUDDY SPOT IN THE PLAYGROUND SOMEWHERE, FACE YOUR FRIEND AND START SQUISHING YOUR WAY DOWN IN THE MUD UNTIL IT'S ALMOST UP TO YOUR WAIST.
WE DID THIS BECAUSE IT WAS FUN. SO KYLE AND I ARE FACING EACH OTHER AND BOGGING OUR WAY DOWN IN THIS MUD PUDDLE. WE GET IT ALMOST TO THE POINT WHERE THE MUD WILL START TO SEEP INTO OUR RUBBER BOOTS. I LOOK AT KYLE AND SAY "HEY KYLE, CAN YOU DO THIS?!" AND I TAKE MY FOOT OUT OF THE BOOT, WIGGLE MY LITTLE SOCKED TOES IN THE SPRING AIR FOR A FEW SECONDS, AND PUT MY LEG BACK IN MY BOOT, WHICH IS FIRMLY LODGED IN MUD.
"YES I CAN!!" KYLE SHOUTS BACK AT ME DESPITE ME BEING ONLY A FOOT AWAY FROM HIM. KYLE TAKES HIS FOOT OUT OF HIS BOOT AND IMMEDIATLY FALLS BACKWARDS INTO THE MUD. BECAUSE ONE LEG IS STILL IN THE BOOT HE IS KIND OF PINNED. THE SUCTION FROM THE MUD IS TOO MUCH FOR HIM TO SIT UP, AND HE CAN'T TURN OVER BECAUSE HIS LEG IS STUCK IN THE BOOT.
THE BELL RINGS AND I LEAVE HIM THERE FOR SOME REASON. IT'S MONDAY MORNING SO WE HAVE ASSEMBLY. THE WHOLE SCHOOL SITS IN THE GYM AND WE SING 'OH CANADA'. OUR PRINCIPAL, WHOSE NAME IS HONEST TO GOD 'MRS. HEGGINBOTTOM' SAYS 'GOOD MORNING STUDENTS' AND THEN WE ALL SAY 'GOOD MORNING MRS. HEGGINBOTTOMBOTTOMBOTTOMBOTTOM' BECAUSE NOBODY CAN GET IT IN SYNC AND SOME KIDS SAY IT FASTER THAN OTHERS.
THEN OUR PRINCIPAL IS ABOUT TO GET INTO THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WHEN THE BIG DOUBLE DOORS IN THE BACK OF THE GYM ARE THROWN OPEN AND SMACK AGAINST THE WALLS WITH A GIANT BANG. ENTER MRS. VAIL, SHORT, BUTCHY VICE PRINCIPAL WITH BICEPS LIKE NOTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN. SHE'S HOLDING KYLE, WHO APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN DRESSED FROM THE LOST AND FOUND. THERE ARE TEARS JUST STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE. WE ALL STARE AT KYLE AND MRS. VAIL LETS HIM GO. HE RUNS TOWARDS ME, SLIPS ON THE GROUND BECAUSE HE'S IN SOCKS FOR SOME REASON, PICKS HIMSELF UP, AND SITS DOWN NEXT TO ME. TOTALLY INCONSOLABLE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. WHEN WE GET HOME HE FINALLY OPENS UP TO ME AND TELLS ME THAT MRS. VAIL PICKED HIM UP OUT OF THE MUD LIKE A DYING SOLDIER AND WASTED NO TIME IN STRIPPING HIM NAKED AND DRESSING HIM UP IN SHORT-SHORTS AND A STRAWBERRY-SHORTCAKE TSHIRT EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A NINJA TURTLE TSHIRT RIGHT THERE. 
SO ALSO IN KINDERGARTEN I APPARENTLY THOUGHT THAT THE KIDS IN MY CLASS DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT COUGARS FOR SOME REASON, BECAUSE I DEFINITELY MADE A SWEET COUGAR QUIZ WHICH I INSISTED ON GIVING OUT TO THE CLASS THE NEXT DAY.
WHAT COLOR IS THE COUGAR? GOLD? NO! BROWN? NO! RED? NO! THE ANSWER IS TAWNY. 
THE FIRST TIME MY DAD TOOK ME AND MY SISTER CAMPING I WAS ABOUT 8 OR 9. I REMEMBER WE PARKED THE CAR, I JUMPED OUT AND IMMEDIATELY STEPPED ON A NAIL. WE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND THEN WE WENT HOME BECAUSE I HAD TO GET A TETANUS SHOT OR SOME KIND OF SHOT. IT'S ALL KIND OF HAZY.
THE SECOND TIME MY DAD TOOK ME AND MY SISTER CAMPING WAS A MONTH LATER, IN THE MIDDLE OF JULY. WE PARKED THE CAR, AND MY SISTER JUMPED OUT AND IMMEDIATELY TRIED TO LIFT UP SOME SORT OF BOULDER THAT WAS ON A HILL. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHY SHE DID THIS. ANYWAY SHE ENDED UP BREAKING HER FINGER. WE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL, AND THEN WE HAD TO GO HOME BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO BE WITH MOM IN HER HOUR OF NEED.
AT THE END OF SUMMER, MY DAD, OUT OF COMPLETE DESPERATION TO GO CAMPING WITH THE KIDS, TOOK US OUT AGAIN. I REMEMBER HE SEEMED A BIT FIDGETY THE WHOLE WAY THERE, AND I REMEMBER HE WOULDN'T LET US OUT OF THE CAR UNTIL HE HAD SCOUTED AROUND A LITTLE BIT.
WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR MY DAD WAS BUSY TAKING THE BUNGEE CORDS OFF THE ROOF. WE HAD ABOUT A BILLION THINGS UP ON THE CAR WHICH MY DAD HAD SECURED WITH AN UNNECESSARY AMOUNT OF BUNGEE CORDS. ANYWAY FOR SOME REASON I UNHOOKED ONE OF THE BUNGEE CORDS ON MY SIDE OF THE CAR. IT WHIZZED OVER THE CAR ROOF LIKE A METEOR AND CUT MY DAD DEEPLY IN HIS EYEBROW. WE HAD TO DRIVE TO THE HOSPITAL, THIS TIME WITH BLOOD STREAMING DOWN MY DAD'S FACE AND ME AND MY SISTER IN TEARS. 
ALSO ONCE AT THE COTTAGE MY DAD AND UNCLE RON ARE NOW ARGUING OVER WHO HAS THE NICEST WATCH. RON IS GOING ON ABOUT HIS IS ATOMIC OR SOMETHING AND MY DAD IS TALKING ABOUT HOW HIS IS POWERED BY WRIST MOVEMENTS AND THEY ARE BOTH MAKING EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS THAT I CAN NEITHER VERIFY NOR DISREGARD. WE ARE ALL WALKING DOWN TO THE BEACH TO GO SWIMMING. AS WE APPROACH THE SHORELINE UNCLE RON CAREFULLY REMOVES HIS WATCH, WRAPS IT IN A CHAMOIS HE MUST HAVE HAD HIDDEN IN HIS BATHING SUIT, AND PLACES IT DAINTILY IN THE CENTER OF A FOLDING CHAIR.
"CAN'T TAKE IT IN THE WATER, EH?!" MY DAD SHOUTS OUT TRIUMPHANTLY AND UNCLE RON GLOWERS. "MY WATCH ISN'T JUST WATER-RESISTANT, IT'S WATER-PROOF!! HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT!" MY DAD SUDDENLY TURNS THE BAND OVER AND SCRUTINIZES THE BACK OF PLATE. "YEP!!!" HE CONTINUES GLEEFULLY "SAYS IT RIGHT HERE - WATERPROOF UP TO 14 WHOLE ATMOSPHERES. WHAT A WATCH!"
RON SILENTLY WADES OUT INTO THE LAKE. MY DAD SPLASHES IN LIKE HE WAS DROPPED OUT OF A PLANE AND SWIMS PAST UNCLE RON, SHOUTING ALL THE WHILE. "14 ATMOSPHERES! THAT'S PRETTY DEEP!! CAN'T DO THAT WITH YOUR WATCH, CAN YOU!" HE SCORES HIS POINT AND TAKES IT FURTHER WITH A LITTLE DIVE UNDER THE WATER. HE SURFACES EXUBERANTLY. "YES, SEE - STILL TICKING!" HE PUTS THE WATCH TO HIS EAR AND SMILES BLISSFULLY ALTHOUGH I'M CONVINCED HE CAN'T HEAR A THING AMID ALL THE SPLASHING HE'S DOING. "YES, THIS IS A FINE PIECE OF CRAFTSMANSHIP. I BET I COULD GO DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE WITH THIS THING!". HE TAKES AN EXAGGERATED DEEP BREATH AND DISAPPEARS INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS OF THE LAKE.
UNCLE RON AND I WAIT. RON LOOKS AS THOUGH THE LAKE IS FULL OF VINEGAR AND HE JUST SWALLOWED A LOT OF IT. ABOUT A MINUTE LATER MY DAD'S HEAD POPS UP A GOOD 50 FEET AWAY FROM. HE'S STILL SHOUTING HAPPILY UNTIL HE LIFTS UP HIS HAND - THE WATCH ISN'T THERE ANYMORE. HE'S SOMEHOW MANAGED TO LOSE IT WHILE SWIMMING AS FAST AS HE COULD UNDER WATER.
A THIN SMILE BEGINS TO CREEP ACROSS UNCLE RON'S FACE AND WITHIN MINUTES HE IS JUST BEAMING. HE STILL REFERS TO THAT TIME AS ONE OF THE BEST SWIMS HE'S EVER TAKEN IN THE LAKE. 
SO THIS KID NAMED DAX USE TO ALWAYS HANG OUT WITH US IN HIGHSCHOOL BUT NEVER EVER EVER SPOKE UNLESS HE WAS ASKED TO ANSWER A QUESTION, AND EVEN THEN THAT WAS A RARE OCCURANCE BECAUSE THE TEACHERS ALL KNEW HE DIDN'T LIKE TO TALK.
ANYWAY ONE DAY WE WERE ALL HANGING OUTSIDE AT LUNCH AND I HAPPENED TO MENTION THAT OUR PHYSICAL SCIENCE TEACHER MR. BLORN SPENT THE ENTIRE GODDAMNED HOUR TALKING ABOUT HOW ROBERTA BONDAR WAS THE FIRST WOMAN ON THE MOON.
"WHAT THE HELL?!" MY FRIEND JASON INTERRUPTS, "EARLIER TODAY BLORN TOLD OUR CLASS THAT ROBERTA BONDAR HATED THE MOON AND ONLY WANTED TO BE THE FIRST WOMAN IN SPACE!"
"GOD DAMMIT!" I REPLIED! "I WONDER WHAT THE HELL HE'S TELLING HIS CLASS RIGHT NOW!"
AT THIS POINT DAX CLEARED HIS THROAT AND WE ALL WENT SILENT. "I BET I KNOW WHAT HE'S TELLING THE CLASS RIGHT NOW" HE SAID IN HIS CREAKY VOICE. WE WERE ABSOLUTELY FLABBERGASTED. THIS WAS A RARE MOMENT INDEED. DAX HIKED UP HIS PANTS, PUT A LEG UP ON THE PICNIC TABLE AND PICKED UP A LONG BRANCH WHICH I IMAGINE WAS SUPPOSE TO BE THE YARDSTICK BLORN CARRIED WITH HIM AT ALL TIMES. THE IMPRESSION WAS LACKING, BUT WE DIDN'T MIND - DAX WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK.
"YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S TELLING THE CLASS RIGHT NOW ABOUT ROBERTA BONDAR?" HE LOOKED AT US IMPRESSIVELY. WE ALL NODDED SILENTLY. DAX MADE AN OBSCENE THRUSTING MOTION WITH HIS PELVIS AND ATTEMPTED A POOR MIMICRY OF MR. BLORN'S SANDY VOICE: "YEAH I FUCKED HER, BOYS. I FUCKED HER REAL GOOOOOOOOD."
ODDEST THING EVER. 
GOOD TIMES PEOPLE, GOOD TIMES. THIS SUCKED UP MY MORNING, BUT I THINK I NEED TO STICK AROUND THE OFFICE EXTRA LONG TODAY. I'LL TRY AND THINK UP SOME MORE STORIES AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO WRITE THEM SO THERE'S A BIT OF A PUNCHLINE OR ENDING AND EVERYTHING GETS TIED UP NEATLY. 
MY CHEMISTRY TEACHER MR. RESTIVE DIDN'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT CHEMISTRY. HE WOULD STAND IN FRONT OF THE CLASS WITH THE OVERHEAD PROJECTOR AIMED AGAINST THE FAR WALL, OPENED TEXTBOOK ON THE DESK NEXT TO IT, AND WOULD JUST COPY STUFF STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TEXTBOOK. WE WERE THEN SUPPOSE TO COPY IT OFF THE OVERHEAD. I REMEMBER THIS ONE AFTERNOON HE GOT ALL INTO HIS SUBJECT AND STOPPED WRITING ON THE OVERHEAD AND HIS BROW FURROWED AND HE WENT SILENT FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES AND THEN SMILED SUDDENLY AND WAS ALL LIKE "HMM. HMM.. HEY, THIS IS KIND OF NEAT!!" AND WE WERE ALL LIKE "JESUS CHRIST" AND MR. RESTIVE IS JUST GLOWING AND HE LOOKS UP AND SAYS 'TURN TO PAGE 72'.
SO WE ALL TURN TO PAGE 72 AND IT'S JUST A BIG BLACK AND WHITE PICTURE OF THESE TWO GERIATRICS SMILING AT EACH OTHER AT DISNEY WORLD OR SOME SHIT. 
THERE WAS THIS KID IN OUR HIGHSCHOOL WHO ALWAYS HAD POO OR SOMETHING IN HIS NOSE AND WE USE TO JUST CALL HIM 'TOODLES' AND ONE DAY HIS DAD SCREECHED INTO THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT AT ABOUT 90MPH AND LEAPT OUT OF THE CAR AND BOUNDED UP THE LANE INTO THE SCHOOL CARRYING THIS GIANT POT. TOODLES WAS HANGING AROUND BY HIMSELF SMELLING LIKE POO LIKE HE ALWAYS DID AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW HIS DAD IS JUST SCREAMING AT HIM ABOUT HOW HE BURNT SOME RICE IN THE POT LAST NIGHT. AND THEN HE TURNS TO THE CROWD OF CURIOUS STUDENTS STANDING IN A BIT OF A SEMI-CIRCLE, AND HE SHOWS US THE POT WHICH HAS BITS OF BURNT RICE STUCK TO THE BOTTOM AND HE YELLS OUT "THIS!! THIS IS A FIRE!!" 
YES THAT IS MY STORY. IT'S A LONG ONE, IT WILL REQUIRE SOME PREPARATION. YES THESE STORIES ARE TRUE.
AT SOME POINT I WILL GET INTO THE STORIES OF CAMP OPEMEKON AND SCOUT CAMP. HERE IS A QUICK SCOUT CAMP STORY:
SO IN CUBS OUR CAMP 'LEADERS' ALL HAD THESE RIDICULOUS FAKE NAMES THAT WHERE TAKEN FROM THE JUNGLE BOOK AND WE WERE SUPPOSE TO ADDRESS THEM AS SUCH. NONE OF THE KIDS WHERE VERY HAPPY WITH THIS, AND EVEN AT AN EARLY AGE WE ALL REALIZED OUR CAMP WAS BEING RUN BY A BUNCH OF NERDY TRY-HARDS WHO SEEMED TO HAVE A THING IF YOUNG BOYS CALLED THEM 'AKELA' OR 'BALOO'. 
ANYWAY SO WE HAD TO DO THIS WINTER CAMP ENDURANCE EMBARASSMENT. IT BOILED DOWN TO SPENDING A FRIGID NIGHT IN A GODDAMNED BARN IN JANUARY. IT WAS AWFUL. I REMEMBER THERE WAS THIS FAT KID NAMED MARK WHO SPENT THE ENTIRE NIGHT MAKING ALL THESE LITTLE LABOROUS NOISES AND GENERALLY SOUNDING FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A BEACHED WHALE. I ALSO REMEMBER AT ABOUT 2 IN THE MORNING (BECAUSE IT WAS TOO COLD TO SLEEP), SOMEONE TOLD MARK THAT THERE WERE 'CORN CHIPS' HIDDEN IN THE HAY SOMEWHERE, AND THEN MARK WENT VERY STILL FOR A WHILE AND THEN 15 MINUTES LATER WE HEARD HIM MUNCHING. SINCE THERE WERE NO 'CORN CHIPS' WE ASSUMED HE WAS ACTUALLY EATING HAY.
SO ANYWAY THE LAST DAY OF THIS WINTER CAMP ABORTION WE WAKE UP TO FIND OUT THE CAMP LEADERS HAVE DECIDED TO TEACH US HOW TO USE A COMPASS. WE ARE TIRED, BROKEN MEN AT THIS POINT AND IN NO MOOD FOR THESE SHENANINGANS. AKELA OR AKIRA OR WHATEVER IS THRUSTING THESE PIECES OF PAPER WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ALL THE KIDS. THERE HAVE GOT TO BE ABOUT 400 DIRECTIONS ON THIS PAPER, ALL SAYING THINGS LIKE "GO 55 DEGREES NWN FOR 400 PACES UNTIL YOU SEE A TREE SHAPED LIKE A VULVA". 
WE ALL GROAN AND THAT FRUIT "BALOO" EXPLAINS TO US THAT THERE'S A BIG SURPRISE WAITING FOR US AT THE END OF OUR "COMPASS QUEST". MORE GROANING. "BALOO" GIVES US THIS WINNING SMILE AND CRIES OUT "IT'S CHOCOLATE!!!!!"
NOW AT THIS POINT WE ARE DEFINITELY IN A BIG SNOWY FIELD IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE AND TO OUR RIGHT IN THE FAR DISTANCE YOU CAN SEE THE WOODS, AND EVERYWHERE ELSE IT'S JUST HORIZON. THERE IS ONE LONELY LITTLE SHED STICKING OUT OF THE GROUND LIKE A BROKEN TOOTH A MILE AWAY.
THEN ADRIAN SAYS "IS THE CHOCOLATE IN THAT SHED?" AND "BALOO" SAYS "WHAT?" AND THEN I REMEMBER WE ALL START
GATHER 'ROUND KIDS, THIS ONE'S A DOOZY 
OH AND VERY QUICKLY
I WAS PLAYING MONOPOLY WITH KYLE ONCE, AND THIS KID SERIOUSLY CAN'T GET ANYTHING STRAIGHT AND DEFINITELY IS NO GOOD AT ANY BOARD GAME AND WHENEVER WE PLAYED MONOPOLY HE WAS USUALLY BUST BY THE THIRD OR FOURTH TIME HE WENT AROUND 'GO'.
ANYWAY THIS ONE TIME HE WENT OUT EXCEPTIONALLY EARLY, EVEN FOR HIM, AND HE THREW HIS LITTLE METAL IRON PIECE ACROSS THE ROOM IN ANGER AND YELLED OUT "I HATE BEING BANK-ROBBED!!!" 
SO I WAS AT THE VIDEO STORE A FEW MONTHS AGO AND THIS GUY AND THIS GIRL WERE LOOKING AT THE NEW RELEASES AND THE GUY SAID "HAVE YOU SEEN AVIATOR? AND THE GIRL SAID "AVIAWHAT?" 
ALRIGHT SO TODAY THERE'S GOING TO BE A FEW STORIES FROM DAYTONA BEACH. SIX YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS SEVENTEEN, MY FRIEND MATT AND I PRETTY MUCH STOLE 30K FROM OUR SCHOOL. SOME OF THE MONEY WENT TO FUND AN OUTDOOR KEG-PARTY WEEKEND THING IN MONTREAL, BUT A LOT OF IT WAS FUNNELED INTO A TRIP TO DAYTONA FOR US AND ABOUT 50 OF OUR FRIENDS. WE RENTED OUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MOST DERELICT SHANTY-MOTEL ON THE ATLANTIC STRIP, AND HAD ONE OF THE BEST TIMES OF OUR LIVES.
COMING SHORTLY: THE JELLYFISH STORY, AND THE RAID STORY.
I JUST NEED TO GET SOME WORK DONE FIRST. I LOVE YOU GUYS. 
ALRIGHT SO WE'VE SURVIVED A 22-HOUR BUSRIDE FROM OTTAWA TO FLORIDA THAT INVOLVED CARL THE WEINER-BOY COMPLAINING ABOUT EVERYTHING, CHRIS BITCHING ABOUT EVERYONE NEEDING TO USE THE BATHROOM IN THE BACK, AND JASON BREAKING HIS BRAND NEW PORTABLE DVD-PLAYER, ONE OF THE FIRST MODELS EVER MADE. 
WE GET TO DAYTONA AS THE SUN RISES. WE PARK IN FRONT OF THE SEEDIEST ESTABLISHMENT I HAVE EVER LAID EYES ON, AND ARE IMMEDIATELY GREETED BY A WIZENED OLD LADY WHO IS DISTRIBUTING TOWELS AND ROOM KEYS LIKE RATIONS AMONG THE TROOPS. SHE CLAIMS HER NAME IS 'ESMERELDA' BUT SHE LOOKS LIKE A JANE TO ME. SHE QUICKLY LAUNCHES INTO A FASCINATING TIRADE ABOUT HOW IF ANY OF THE FACILITIES IN THE MOTEL DON'T WORK, IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY BROKEN THEM. 
I, OF COURSE, AM ALREADY RUNNING TOWARDS THE BEACH. I JUMP IN THE WATER AND SWIM OUT ABOUT 50 FEET AT WHICH POINT I AM STUNG BY A JELLYFISH AND GO INTO ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK. JASON, ALWAYS A BRO, JUMPS IN THE WATER AND HELPS ME GET OUT. WITH MY ARM OVER HIS SHOULDER I STAGGER TO THE FRONT DESK WHERE ESMERLDA IS NOW EXCITEDLY GOING OVER THE LIST-OF-THINGS-THAT-WILL-LOSE-US-OUR-DEPOSITS. I TELL HER SHE NEEDS TO CALL AN AMBULANCE AND SHE GIVES ME A SOUR LOOK. "WHAT ABOUT A CAB?" SHE SAYS? 
"I DON'T REALLY HAVE TIME FOR A CAB, I'M DYING" I REPLY SHORTLY.
ESMERELDA BEGINS TO HAGGLE. "LOOK, WHY DON'T WE CALL A CAB FIRST, AND THEN IF IT GETS REALLY BAD WE'LL CALL AN AMBULANCE" SHE SAYS DOUBTFULLY. CLEARLY SHE DOESN'T WANT AN AMBULANCE PARKED IN FRONT OF HER RAT-INFESTED MOTEL.
JASON RUNS INSIDE THE MOTEL AND CALLS AN AMBULANCE WHILE ESMERELDA AND I CONTINUE TO ARGUE OVER THE RELATIVE MERITS OF AMBULANCE VS CAB. FORTUNATELY THERE'S ONE NEARBY AND THEY STOP BY THE MOTEL AND PUT ME ON THE STRETCHER AND TAKE ME TO THE HOSPITAL. JASON JUMPS IN THE BACK WITH ME.
AT THE HOSPITAL I GO THROUGH THE USUAL - ADRENALINE, NOREPIPINEPHRINE, AND A TON OF BENADRYL DUMPED DIRECTLY INTO THE IV. AS YOU ALL KNOW, BENADRYL MAKES YOU VERY SLEEPY, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A HUGE DOSE PUMPED INTO YOU INTRAVENOUSLY. WITHIN ABOUT 20 MINUTES I AM SO SLEEPY I CAN BARELY STAND UP, YET AM BEING VERY STUBBORN ABOUT GOING BACK TO THE BEACH. AN HOUR LATER I AM IN THE CLEAR AND RELEASED, DESPITE THE NURSE THINKING I SHOULD STAY OVERNIGHT.
JASON AND I MAKE SOME EDUCATED GUESSES AND FIND A BUS THAT WILL GET US BACK NEAR OUR HOTEL. I CAN BARELY STAND ON THE BUS. I'M STILL IN A WET BATHING SUIT AND TSHIRT AND THAT NOSE-PLUG THING THAT DELIVERS OXYGEN IS DANGLING OUT OF MY POCKET AND I'M TOTTERING ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE BUS STOPS AND OUR MOTEL IS IN SIGHT. THE DOORS IN THE BACK OPEN UP AND I FALL OUT OF THE BUS AND LAND RIGHT ON MY FACE. GASH OPEN MY HEAD AND FALL ASLEEP AT THE SAME TIME. JASON WAKES ME UP, HE LOOKS REALLY CONCERNED.
WE SLOWLY MAKE OUR WAY BACK TO THE MOTEL WITH BLOOD POURING DOWN MY FACE AND BYSTANDERS STARING AT US. WE GET INTO OUR HOTEL ROOM AND I FALL ASLEEP FOR ABOUT 20 HOURS. SO MUCH FOR DAY 1 AT DAYTONA.
WHEN I WAKE UP I IMMEDIATELY FEEL LIKE GOING SWIMMING. I OPEN THE DOOR AND WALK OUTSIDE AND MAKE MY WAY DOWN TO THE BEACH. 20 FEET LATER I SUDDENLY GET VERY TIRED AGAIN, AND SPOT A HOT-TUB FULL OF ELDERY PEOPLE OVER THE FENCE BEHIND THE HUGE HOLIDAY INN THAT'S RIGHT NEXT TO US. I DECIDE THAT'S MUCH CLOSER AND CLIMB THE FENCE AND START WALKING TOWARDS ALL THESE OLD PEOPLE.
THIS HOT TUB MUST HAVE ABOUT TWO DOZEN OCTOGENARIANS CRAMMED IN THERE LIKE SARDINES, AND THEY ARE ALL STARING AT ME. OF COURSE I HAVE A TON OF DRIED BLOOD ON MY FACE BUT I DON'T REMEMBER THAT, AND I MUST LOOK LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE AS I WOBBLED TOWARDS THEM. A FEW REALLY OLD WOMEN WITH LOOKS OF ABSOLUTE TERROR ON THEIR FACES PUSH AWAY FROM ME AS I EASE MYSELF INTO THE HOTTUB.
I'M STILL IN MY BATHING SUIT SO THINGS ARE LOOKING GOOD, BUT WHEN I TAKE MY TSHIRT OFF LIFE STARTS TO GET INTERESTING. I'M TOTALLY COVERED IN THOSE LITTLE ELECTRODE-MONITOR THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE LITTLE METAL NIPPLES. THEY'RE STUCK ALL OVER MY BODY FROM WHEN I WAS HAVING MY VITAL SIGNS OBSERVED. I DON'T REALIZE THIS. PRETTY SOON THE BUBBLING WATER WORKS ITS MAGIC AND MY GERIATRIC AUDIENCE WATCHES IN AMAZEMENT AND DISGUST AS SEVERAL OF THESE LITTLE THINGS LOOSEN FROM MY BODY AND START FLOATING AROUND THE HOTTUB. EVERYONE'S AVOIDING ME BUT NOBODY'S GETTING OUT. I JUST SIT THERE BLISSFULLY, MY FACE CAKED IN BLOOD AND DIRT AND A LITTLE SPHERE OF ELECTRODE-MONITORS BOBBING AROUND ME LIKE LITTLE SILVER WATER-LILLIES.
FINALLY THIS ONE OLD MAN ACROSS ME STARTS SHOOTING THESE BALEFUL LOOKS AT HIS COMPATRIOTS, AND THEN ADDRESSES ME DIRECTLY: "SON, YOUR HOO-HAS ARE FLOATIN' AROUND THE POO'" 
DAY THREE AT DAYTONA: MARK, JASON, CHRIS AND I ARE SITTING AROUND COMFORTABLY IN OUR HOTEL ROOM. THE DAY BEFORE JASON HAD BOUGHT A STUFFED CRAB FROM THE GROCERY STORE AND 'ACCIDENTLY' LEFT IT IN THE MICROWAVE FOR ALMOST HALF AN HOUR. THE RESULTING SMELL WAS SO BAD AND SO PERMANENT THAT WE WERE MOVED TO ANOTHER ROOM. THIS WAS JUST FINE AND DANDY, AS OUR OLD ROOM HAD A MALFUNCTIONING TOILET. 
SO WE'RE SITTING AROUND DRINKING WHEN CARL THE WIENER-BOY BURSTS IN AND TELLS US OUR HOTEL IS BEING RAIDED BY THE POLICE. YOU NEED TO MEET CARL TO UNDERSTAND HIM. HE IS CONSTANTLY HIGH-STRUNG AND EVEN THE MOST PERFUNCTORY ACTION IS THE BIGGEST DEAL TO HIM.
JASON BELCHES PEACEABLY. "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT NOW, CARL"
CARL IS LOOKING AROUND HIM WILDLY. "THE COPS! THE COPS ARE HERE AND THEY'RE BREAKING INTO EVERYONE'S ROOM AND LOOKING FOR ALCOHOL AND ARRESTING ANYONE WHO ISN'T 21!!!"
MARK LOOKS AROUND HIM AT THE IMPRESSIVE ARRAY OF LIQUOR WE'VE GOT WITH US. WE PROBABLY HAVE THE MOST ALCOHOL OUT OF EVERYONE IN THE MOTEL. HE LOOKS AT ME INQUISITIVELY. "CARL, GO HOME" HE SAYS.
IT'S TOO LATE - CARL'S ALREADY JUMPED OVER ONE OF THE BEDS AND IS RUNNING TOWARDS SEVERAL BOTTLES OF HARD LIQUOR ON THE MANTLE. HE GRABS A 60 OF RUM AND ONE OF WHISKY AND RUNS INTO THE BATHROOM.
THIS SHIT DEFINITELY DOESN'T FLY IN OUR PARTICULAR MOTEL ROOM. I TELL JASON TO START PUTTING THE ALCOHOL INTO EMPTY COKE BOTTLES AND LARGE CUPS FOR NOW, AND FOLLOW MARK INTO THE BATHROOM, WHERE CARL HAS BEGUN TO POUR WHISKEY DOWN THE BATHTUB. MARK SLAPS CARL IN THE FACE, HARD.
"CARL YOU LITTLE WEINER, GET OUT OF HERE!" MARK BELLOWS.
CARL LOOKS AT MARK, THEN AT ME, AND MAKES SOME SORT OF FEEBLE REMONSTRATION ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO GET RID OF THE ALCOHOL. MARK REMAINS UNMOVED AND WE ESCORT CARL OUT.
WHEN I OPEN THE FRONT DOOR (WE'RE ON THE THIRD FLOOR), I NOTICED AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF MY FRIENDS MILLING ABOUT ON THE BALCONY BELOW US LOOKING UNCOMFORTABLE, AND SEE SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS DOING A BIT OF A METHODICAL SEARCH. CARL'S LITTLE SPASM ISN'T ENTIRELY FABRICATED, IT SEEMS.
WE EMPTY THE LAST OF OUR ALCOHOL INTO TWO LITER BOTTLES AND ABOUT A DOZEN PLASTIC CUPS, AND THROW THE BOTTLES OUT THE BACK WINDOW ONTO THE BEACH. A MINUTE LATER THERE'S A KNOCK ON OUR DOOR AND COPS COME INTO OUR ROOM. THEY'RE VERY FRIENDLY AND POLITE, AND SAY THERE HAVE BEEN COMPLAINTS OF UNDERAGE DRINKING AND THEY KNOW IT'S SPRING BREAK BUT THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOBS. THEY DON'T LOOK VERY HARD, AND LEAVE QUICKLY.
THIS CALLS FOR A CELEBRATION. MARK, JASON, CHRIS AND I ALL GRAB A RANDOM CUP EACH AND START DOING SHOTS.
OF COURSE JASON, IN HIS UNENDING HASTE, JUST HAD TO EMPTY A BOTTLE OF RUBBING ALCOHOL CHRIS'S MOM PACKED IN HIS KNAPSACK INTO A CUP, AND OF COURSE I JUST HAD TO CHOOSE THAT PARTICULAR CUP FOR MY CELEBRATION. SINCE I'M ALREADY DRUNK I CAN'T REALLY TASTE THE DIFFERENCE, BUT TEN MINUTES LATER I KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG. I GO DOWNSTAIRS WITH JASON, WHERE I PLAN TO SIT IN THE LOBBY UNTIL THINGS EITHER GET BETTER OR I NEED ANOTHER AMBULANCE. I DON'T REALLY MAKE IT THAT FAR - ON THE FIRST FLOOR I KIND OF FALL OVER AND CAN'T STAND UP ANYMORE. I REMEMBER BEING REALLY DIZZY. ANOTHER MINUTE AND I'M PASSED OUT FACE DOWN.
NOW FOR SOME WEIRD REASON THIS ONE KID I DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT WELL SUDDENLY COMES INTO THE PICTURE (WORD TRAVELS FAST IN THE MOTEL WHEN THERE'S TROUBLE AND THERE'S ALREADY ABOUT 30 KIDS STANDING AROUND ME). ANYWAY THIS KID, ROBBIE, APPARENTLY SHOUTS OUT SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF "I'VE WATCHED A VIDEO ON SAFETY" AND LEAPS INTO THE FRAY. FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD HE LOOKS ME UP AND DOWN AND ISSUS HIS EXPERT OPINION THAT I NEED TO BE ON MY SIDE. HE THEN GRABS ME BY THE BACK OF MY HEAD AND PULLS MY HEAD UP. UNFORTUNATELY I'M SOAKING WET, IN SOME SORT OF WEIRD COLD-SWEAT, AND ROBBIE'S EXPERT GRIP FAILS HIM. MY HEAD CRASHES BACK DOWN AND I RIP MY HEAD OPEN AGAIN ON THE HALL FLOOR. AMBULANCE COMES, JASON ONCE AGAIN HOPS IN THE BACK. WHEN I RETURN LATER THAT NIGHT ESMERELDA GIVES ME A WITHERING LOOK. 
FUCK I THOUGHT OF SOME REALLY GOOD SHORT ONES WHEN I WAS WALKING TO WORK BUT I DON'T REMEMBER THEM NOW!
THE WELL IS DRY RIGHT NOW!
MAYBE I WILL JUST START POSTING ENTRIES FROM THE STORY I AM WRITING 
MAN SO IN GRADE 1 I HAD MY FIRST 'CRUSH' ON THIS GIRL NAMED PAMELA WHO WAS THE FASTEST KID IN SCHOOL. SHE WAS IN MY GYM CLASS AND WE USE TO START OFF GYM WITH OUR IDIOT TEACHER MR. BILEN PUTTING IN SOME 80S JAM IN THE TAPEDECK AND THEN WE'D ALL RUN LAPS TO 'GET OUT OF MY DREAMS, GET INTO MY CAR!!' OR SOMETHING. ANYWAY PAMELA WOULD ALWAYS LAP THE REST OF THE CLASS WITHIN MINUTES. FUCK SHE WAS FAST.
ANYWAY ONE DAY AT LUNCH IN THE PLAYGROUND I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED BUT I DID SOMETHING SUPER NICE FOR HER OR I HELPED HER UP WHEN SHE FELL OR SOMETHING, BUT ANYWAY SHE DECIDED TO 'REWARD' ME BY TELLING ME ON MONDAY WE COULD HOLD HANDS WHILE WE RAN LAPS AROUND THE GYM. IT WAS LIKE TUESDAY AT THIS POINT.
SO EVERY DAY THAT WEEK AFTER SCHOOL I WOULD GO HOME AND RUN LAPS AROUND MY HOUSE, TRYING TO GET FASTER. I WAS SO WORRIED THAT SHE WOULD BE DRAGGING ME BEHIND HER IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS AT GYM. I THINK ACTUALLY DID GET FASTER, BUT I WAS STILL WORRIED. SUNDAY NIGHT FOUND ME IN MY ROOM CRYING BECAUSE I STILL DIDN'T THINK I WAS FAST ENOUGH AND WAS SERIOUSLY TERRIFIED AND DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL.
NEXT DAY AT GYM PAMELA SINGLES ME OUT RIGHT AWAY AND TELLS ME TO HOLD HER HAND. WE'RE ALL STANDING AROUND AT THIS POINT AND MR. BILEN PUTS IN THE FLAVOR OF THE WEEK AND WE ALL START RUNNING. INSTANTLY I FEEL MYSELF GETTING YANKED FORWARD BY PAMELA WHO IS MOVING LIKE A GODDAMNED BULLET AND SHE KEEPS YELLING 'FASTER!! FASTER!!' AND SHE'S STRINGING ME ALL AROUND THE GODDAMNED GYM AND IT'S JUST LIKE MY NIGHTMARES.
ANYWAY EVERYTIME SHE KEEPS YELLING 'FASTER!!' I ACTUALLY MAKE AN EFFORT TO SOMEHOW RUN 'HARDER' AND IT'S TOTALLY WORKING. BY LIKE THE 8TH OR 9TH TIME SHE'S YELLED OUT 'FASTER!!' I'M ACTUALLY KEEPING UP WITH HER AND I FEEL LIKE GODDAMNED HERME HIMSELF AND THEN SHE YELLS OUT 'FASTER!!' AND I ACTUALLY START BEATING HER. AND THEN SHE YELLS OUT 'OKAY THAT'S TOO FAST!' AND I REMEMBER THE WHOLE CLASS IS JUST STARING AT ME IN TOTAL DISBELIEF AND EVEN MR. BILEN SEEMS TO HAVE LOST SOME OF HIS COLOR AND FOR THE REST OF ELEMENTARY I WAS THE FASTEST KID IN SCHOOL. 
ALRIGHT SO I SHOWED PROMISE IN PRESCHOOL AND WAS CHOSEN FOR THIS SPECIAL 'EARLY START' PROGRAM WITH 3 OTHER LOSERS IN MY PROVINCE AND WE SPENT THE MAJORITY OF OUR KINDERGARTEN YEAR IN A MUSEUM. KIND OF SWEET, BUT I DIDN'T LEARN MUCH AND WHEN I WENT TO A REGULAR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN GRADE ONE I WAS THROWN INTO THESE SPECIAL 'ENRICHMENT' CLASSES BECAUSE OF IT. ENRICHMENT SUCKED. IT WAS DONE OVER HALF OF OUR LUNCH AND THE 'BRIGHT' KIDS FROM GRADES 1-6 WOULD GET TOGETHER AND WE'D BE GIVEN THESE RIDICULOUS PROJECTS.
ANYWAY I REMEMBER THIS ONE YEAR THE PROJECT FOR THE ENRICHMENT KIDS IN GRADES 1-3 WAS TO DO SOME LOSER PRESENTATION OF 'THE LOON' OR SOMETHING, WHICH WAS THIS TOTALLY RANDOM INDIAN/NATIVE AMERICAN NARRATIVE THAT INVOLVED THINGS LIKE TREE SPIRITS AND MENORRAHS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE.
ANYWAY I AM PRETTY SURE OUR ENRICHMENT TEACHER HAD IT ALL PLANNED OUT IN HER HEAD BECAUSE SHE SUGGESTED WE HANG UP A SHEET AND MAKE A TON OF CARDBOARD CUTOUTS AND THEN BUY A REALLY POWERFUL BULB AND DO A SHADOW-PRESENTATION WHERE THE AUDIENCE WOULD ONLY SEE THE SILHOUETTES OF OUR CUTOUTS PRESSED GAAINST THE SHEETS, ILLUMINATED FROM BEHIND BY THE BULB. WHICH IS KIND OF DUMB BUT OF COURSE NOBODY FELT LIKE ARGUING SO THIS IS WHAT WE DID.
JEFF AND I IMMEDIATELY GOT SCREWED AND HAD TO DO ALL THE CUTOUTS FOR SCENERY. IF YOU DON'T KNOW, 'THE LOON' IS PRIMARILY BASED IN THE GODDAMNED REEDS, WHICH IS THE WORST SORT OF SCENERY TO MAKE IF YOU'RE DOING CARDBOARD CUTOUTS AND JEFF AND I WERE REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME OF IT. I WAS SUGGESTED WE JUST TAPE A BUNCH OF COMBS TOGETHER AND PUT THAT UP AGAINST THE SHEET BUT THE TEACHER SHOT IT DOWN FOR NO GOOD REASON AND JEFF AND I SPENT HOURS MAKING THE SCENERY.
SO OTHER KIDS ARE MAKING CUTOUTS OF THE CHARACTERS AND EASY THINGS LIKE THAT, AND WE'RE GLUING THEM TO STRAIGHTENED-OUT COAT HANGERS SO THAT THE PUPPETEERS CAN MANIPULATE THEM ACROSS THE SCREEN WITHOUT THEIR HANDS CASTING SHADOWS AND THIS IS REALLY TURNING INTO A BIG THING AND SOMEHOW THE TEACHER DECIDES WE SHOULD PRESENT THIS LITTLE SHOW IN THE AUDITORIUM IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL.
SO THE BIG DAY COMES, JEFF AND I ARE SITTING TO THE SIDE, THERE ARE PEOPLE'S PARENTS HERE FOR SOME REASON, AND THE MAIN PUPPETEER IS THIS GIRL WHO I ACTAULLY THINK WAS NAMED SADDAM. SADDAM WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOON, AND SHE HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN FEELING PRETTY IMPORTANT AND IT WAS ALL SHE TALKED ABOUT FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
SO THE AUDITORIUM LIGHTS GO OUT AND A HUSH SETTLES OVER THE CROWDS AND THEN THAT SINGLE 800 WATT BULB IS TURNED ON AND THE BED-SHEET-SCREEN IS ILLUMINATED. OUR GODDAMNED REEDS AND TREES ARE LEANED UP AGAINST IT AND JEFF AND I SMILE IN SATISFACTION BECAUSE THAT SHIT LOOKS DAMN GOOD. THE TEACHER TURNS ON THE TAPE DECK AND THE ROOM IS FILLED WITH THE SOUNDS OF A LOON CALLING, BIRD CHIRPS, RUNNING WATER, SOME NATIVE AMERICANS DOING A POW-WOW FAR OFF IN THE DISTANCE, YOU KNOW, NATURE THINGS. THEN THE BOY WHO WAS SELECTED TO NARRATE BEGINS:
"LONG AGO, WHEN THE WORLD WAS GREEN, A SINGLE LOON SWAM ALL ALONE IN A SACRED LAKE WITH EMERALD SHORES"
OR YOU KNOW, SOMETHING RIDICULOUS. SADDAM PICKS UP HER LOON BY THE COAT-HANGER AND MAKES THE LOON DO THIS RIDICULOUS LITTLE HOPPY DANCE ACROSS THE SHEET.. THAT IS UNTIL SHE ACCIDENTLY TOUCHES HER HAND AGAINST THE BULB SOMEHOW. ALL WE HEAR IS THIS SLIGHT HISSING NOISE, SADDAM CRYING OUT IN PAIN, AND THE LOON TAKES THIS TERRIBLE FALL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SHEET AND KNOCKS OVER OUR GODDAMNED SCENERY.
THEN ALL YOU HEAR IS JEFF YELL OUT "MY REEDS! MY FUCKING REEDS!" AND LIKE THIS IS GRADE 1. 6 YEAR OLDS DON'T SAY 'FUCK' IN FRONT OF GROWNUPS AND TEACHERS. THE LIGHTS GO ON AND THERE'S ALL THIS CONFUSION. SADDAM HAS BURNT HER HAND PRETTY BADLY, THERE'S A LITTLE 'TEAM' OF PEOPLE ATTENDING HER WOUNDS, THE ENRICHMENT TEACHER IS TRYING TO KEEP THE SHOW GOING, EVERYBODY IS STARING IN MY DIRECTION AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO SWORE, AND ABOVE ALL OF THIS I CAN STILL FAINTLY HERE THE NATIVES DOING THERE LITTLE POW-WOW HEYA-HOYA'S BECAUSE NOBODY HAS STOPPED THE TAPE.
THE NEXT YEAR AT ENRICHMENT WE HAD THE SAME TEACHER AND OUR PROJECT WAS TO MAKE OUR OWN BOARD GAME. 
SO IN JR. HIGH SCHOOL A BUNCH OF US TOOK THE CITY BUS TO SCHOOL AND BACK BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH SCHOOL BUSSES MAKING THE TRIP TO WYCHWOOD (WHERE A BUNCH OF US LIVED). ANYWAY THERE WAS THIS ONE GIRL NAMED CINDY WHO WE ALL HATED. SHE WAS ENORMOUS (WHICH OBVIOUSLY ISN'T A GOOD REASON TO HATE SOMEONE BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE 12) AND SHE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO TONE TO HER VOICE. SERIOUSLY. WHEN SHE SPOKE IT SOUNDED LIKE A TRASH COMPACTOR HAD JUST COME TO LIFE AND WAS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE. AND SHE WAS DUMB AND PERPETUALLY AGGRAVATED AND JUST NO FUN TO BE AROUND.
SO ANYWAY THIS ONE DAY WE'RE ON THE BUS HEADING HOME. THE CITY BUS DRIVERS HATED TO PICK US UP BECAUSE WE'RE LOUD NOISY KIDS, AND THE DRIVER THAT GOT SHAFTED WITH THE 3:45 STOP AT HADLEY JR HIGH ALWAYS TRIED TO BE ABOUT 5 MINUTES EARLY SO THAT HE'D ONLY PICK UP THE STUDENTS WHO DIDN'T DICK AROUND IN THE LOCKER BAYS AND LEFT THE SCHOOL THE MINUTE THE BELL RANG AND RAN UP THAT FUCKING HILL IN ORDER TO CATCH THE CITY BUS.
ANYWAY YEAH, THIS ONE TIME THE BUS DRIVER IS ON TIME SO WE'RE ALL WAITING FOR HIM AND WE ALL PILE INTO THE BUS. CINDY IS ALWAYS THE LAST ONE ON, NOT BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LEAVE THE SCHOOL ON TIME, BUT BECAUSE SHE CAN'T RUN UPHILL VERY WELL DUE TO HER SIZEABLE GIRTH. SO SHE'D ALWAYS BE THE ONE WHO HAD TO STAND ON THE CITY BUS. SO ANYWAY THIS PARTICULAR TIME I'M SITTING IN THE VERY BACK ROW, DEAD CENTER, AND CINDY IS STANDING ABOUT 10 FEET IN FRONT OF ME.
MY FRIEND BEN AND I ARE JUST BEING RUTHLESS TO HER. DEFINITELY NOT COOL, BUT AGAIN WE'RE 12 AND ENJOYING OURSELVES. CINDY, ALWAYS IN A FOUL MOOD TO BEGIN WITH, IMMEDIATELY STARTS FROTHING AT THE MOUTH AND STARTS MAKING THESE DISTINCT GURGLING NOISES SHE MAKES WHEN SHE'S IRRITATED. BEN AND I DON'T STOP AND KEEP MAKING JOKES AT HER EXPENSE. CINDY'S BOMBASTIC CHASSIS BEGINS TO SHAKE AND QUIVER ALL OVER AND HER LITTLE BEEDY EYES NARROW. THIS IS ALWAYS A SIGN THAT WE'RE APPROACHING THE APEX OF HER WRATH, AND TODAY IS NO EXCEPTION. 
VERY SUDDENLY CINDY STRAIGHTENS UP AND BASICALLY SCREAMS OUT IN THAT ROBOTIC WHEEZE OF HERS "LOOK OUT EVERYBODY!!! IMA GONNA KICK DAVID IN THE FACE!!!!!"
I KIND OF SIT UP SMARTLY AND FEEL LIKE I'VE JUST COME OUT OF A DREAM OR SOMETHING. HAVING THIS MASSIVE BEAST OF A WOMAN KICK ME IN THE FACE IS A SOBERING THOUGHT. I'M CONTEMPLATING THE WHOLE SITUATION WHEN CINDY BEGINS HER CHARGE AND SLOWLY PLOWS TOWARDS ME LIKE A LINEBACKER. I'M THINKING I MIGHT HAVE 5, 10 SECONDS BEFORE I'M ON THE RECEIVING END OF A FLABBY FOOT WHEN CINDY SUDDENLY KICKS FORWARD.
AT THIS POINT SHE IS STILL A GOOD 9 FEET AWAY FROM ME. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE MISJUDGE DISTANCE SO BADLY IN MY LIFE. SHE HAS TAKEN MAYBE 2 STEPS, TOPS, AND HAS SOMEHOW DECIDED HER TONELESS WRETCH OF A LEG IS GOING TO REACH ME. OF COURSE IT DOESN'T, BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT SHE DOES MANAGE TO KICK THIS 80 YEAR OLD WOMAN SITTING QUIETLY RIGHT IN THE FACE.
THE WOMAN JUST SORT OF TOPPLES OVER BACKWARDS AND IS TOTALLY LIMP. I AM POSITIVE HER NECK MUST BE BROKEN IN A THOUSAND PLACES, IF HER SKULL ISN'T FRACTURED ALL TOGETHER. CINDY IS BELLOWING LIKE A HARPOONED WHALE, EYES CLOSED. SHE ISN'T EVEN LOOKING AND SHE'S STILL ON THE RAMPAGE. SHE TURNS ABOUT 10 DEGREES TO HER LEFT AND KICKS AGAIN. ONCE MORE I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF SHE HONESTLY THINKS SHE'S ANYWHERE NEAR ME.
THIS TIME CINDY KICKS THIS POOR KID'S DISCMAN RIGHT OUT OF HIS HANDS. I REMEMBER THE DISCMAN DESCRIBED THIS BEAUTIFUL ARC ACROSS THE BUS AND PULLED THE KIDS EARPHONES OUT OF HIS EARS. HE LOOKED UP IN A HURRY, I CAN TELL YOU THAT MUCH, AND TURNED GODDAMNED WHITE WHEN HE SAW CINDY IN FRONT OF HIM, HER MONSTROUS MOUTH OPEN AS WIDE AS A HIPPO'S. I FELT AWFUL FOR HIM.
THEN CINDY KIND OF OPENS HER EYES AND QUIETS DOWN. THE BUS DRIVER IS PUSHING HIS WAY THROUGH THE CRUSH OF ASTONISHED KIDS TOWARDS CINDY. THE OLD LADY I SERIOUSLY THINK IS DEAD, AND IS LYING VERY STILL WITH HER HEAD TILTED BACK TO AN UNNATURAL DEGREE. THE BUS DRIVER GRABS CINDY BY THE SHOULDERS, TURNS HER AROUND AND MAKES HER GET OFF THE BUS.
THEN HE WALKS UP TO THE OLD WOMAN, GRABS HER BY THE SHOULDERS, SHAKES HER LIKE A CAN OF PAINT AND SHE IS MIRACULOUSLY REVIVED AND LOOKS A LITTLE DAZED BUT OTHERWISE OKAY. THEN THE DRIVER SAYS SOMETHING MENACING TO BEN AND I, TURNS AROUND ABRUPTLY AND MARCHES BACK TO THE FRONT OF THE BUS. WE TAKE OFF.
I TAKE A QUICK LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SEE CINDY STANDING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. SHE'S SWINGING THOSE COLOSSAL ARMS OF HERS AROUND LIKE LOGS AND IS DEFINITELY STILL SCREAMING AND SHOUTING OUT NONSENSE. BEN YELLS OUT 'HEY CINDY!!' AND SHE TURNS TO US AND THE LAST THING SHE SEES THAT DAY IS BEN HOLD UP HER KNAPSACK TO THE WINDOW WITH A GIANT GRIN ON HIS FACE. 
ALRIGHT HERE'S A GOOD STORY ABOUT BEN.
THIS ONE TIME ON HALLOWEEN HE TOLD ME HE HAD BOUGHT A HUGE PUMPKIN AND AN OLD SUIT AND WAS GOING TO STUFF THE SUIT WITH LEAVES, CLIMB IN IT, PUT THE HOLLOWED OUT PUMPKIN ON HIS HEAD, AND SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF EVERY KID WHO CAME TRICK-OR-TREATING. WE'RE LIKE 14 AT THIS POINT.
I THINK IT'S A MARVELOUS IDEA, ESPECIALLY SINCE BEN LIVES 5 STREETS DOWN FROM ME AND I CAN WATCH THE HAVOK FROM A SAFE DISTANCE.
SO HALLOWEEN NIGHT THINGS ARE WORKING FLAWLESSLY. BEN IS REALLY SCARING EVERYBODY, BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS IT'S JUST A DUMMY WITH A CARVED HEAD PLACED ON TOP. BEN IS REALLY GETTING QUITE ARTISTIC ABOUT HIS SCARING PROCEDURES, FINDING IT BEST TO USE SMALL, SUBTLE MOVEMENTS TO GET THE BEST REACTIONS OUT OF PEOPLE. THE NIGHT IS YOUNG, WE ARE YOUNG, LIFE IS GOOD.
SO THEN I SEE MY DAD AND MY LITTLE SISTER COMING UP THE STREET. I AM REALLY REALLY HAPPY NOW. I WATCH THEM, ALMOST PAINFULLY, SLOWLY MAKE THEIR WAY UP TO BEN'S HOUSE. THE EXCITEMENT IS ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR ME. FINALLY THEY ARE COMING UP THE DRIVEWAY. THEY GET TO THE DOOR AND BOTH LOOK APPROVINGLY AT THE MOTIONLESS PUMPKIN-HEADED CREATURE SITTING IN THE CHAIR. 
BEN THIS TIME DECIDES FOR A LITTLE MORE DIRECT ACTION AND STANDS UP SWIFTLY. MY SISTER SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER AND MY DAD GOES "AHHHHHHHHH!!!" AND AND JUST FUCKING NAILS THE PUMPKIN-MAN RIGHT IN THE HEAD. THE PUMPKIN BREAKS OPEN AND LITTLE PIECES OF IT FALL OFF, REVEALING A VERY FRIGHTENED AND BLACKEN-EYED BEN, WHO BEGINS TO REEL AROUND AND LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO COLLAPSE ANY MINUTE. MY DAD YELLS OUT 'OH SHIT!' AND STRAIGHTENS BEN UP AND BRINGS HIM BACK TO HIS LAWN CHAIR WHERE HE SITS DOWN AND PROFFERS SOME LAME APOLOGIES TO BEN AND BEN'S PARENTS WHO HAVE OF COURSE ARRIVED ON SCENE BY THIS POINT.
BEST HALLOWEEN EVER!!! 
ALSO THERE IS A 7" IN CREATION SOMEWHERE THAT HAS A PICTURE OF MY DAD ON IT ON THE FRONT. MY DAD HAS A HUGE BEARD, LOOKS TO BE IN HIS LATE 20S, AND IS GIVING A GIANT THUMBS UP AND A GIANT SMILE. THERE IS A RAINBOW IN THE BACKGROUND AND IN THE RAINBOW'S OUTERMOST ARC READ THE WORDS "100% GROOVY!"
I FOUND THIS IN THE BASEMENT SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND ALMOST PASSED OUT I GOT SO HAPPY. THEN I CALLED MY DAD DOWNSTAIRS WITH A GIANT "HEY DAD WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS" AND MY DAD COMES DOWN, LOOKS SLIGHTLY OUT-OF-SORTS, THEN GRABS THE 7" AND SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT HOW HE'S GOING TO THE STORE. TO THIS DAY HE REFUSES TO TALK ABOUT IT AND I'VE NEVER SEEN IT SINCE. 
ALSO THIS ONE TIME JENN AND I ARE HANGING OUT AND MY DAD SHOWS UP AND IS LIKE 'HERE, I'M STARVING, WHY DON'T YOU GET SOME GROCERIES' AND HE GIVES ME A HUNDRED DOLLARS. SO JENN AND I JUMP IN THE CAR AND DO THE RIGHT THING AND RETURN 15 MINUTES LATER WITH $100 IN ALCOHOL AND MY DAD JUST SIGHS AND HE HAD TO EAT AT A RESTAURANT THAT NIGHT. GOOD TIMES!!!! 
SO BRENT AND I FINISH PLAYING THIS SHOW AND WE MAKE LIKE $20 SO WE DECIDE IT'S HIGH TIME FOR MCDONALDS FRIES. OF COURSE WE'RE DRUNK BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE CAR SO WE NEED TO CALL UP BRENT'S GIRLFRIEND TO DRIVE US TO MCDONALDS. ONCE THERE WE'RE REALLY DRUNK AND I JUMP OUT OF THE CAR AND CLIMB UP THE ROOF OF THE MCDONALDS AND START RUNNING AROUND AND SCREAMING DOWN THOSE BIG METAL PIPES THAT STICK OUT OF THE CEILING AND I CAN HEAR THE EMPLOYEES DOWN BELOW SAYING THINGS LIKE 'WHO IS THAT?!" AND SOUNDING ALL CONCERNED AND MEANWHILE BRENT & BAR ARE IN THE CAR IN THE DRIVE-THRU LANE WONDERING IF THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME GET ME.
ANYWAY I COME BACK DOWN AND GET IN THE CAR AND BRENT ROLLS DOWN HIS WINDOW AND THE MCDONALD DUDE GIVES HIM HIS FOOD AND IS LIKE "SAY BUDDY, HAVE YOU SEEN A CRAZY DUDE RUNNING AROUND ON THE ROOF?"
AND I SIT BOLT UPRIGHT AND LEAN FORWARD INTO THE FRONT AND I START SAYING VERY LOUDLY "NO BUT I WILL FIND THAT MOTHERFUCKER IF YOU JUST GIVE US THESE FRIES FOR FREE. JUST GIVE THEM TO US FOR FREE AND I'LL GET ON THE ROOF SO QUICKLY IT'LL MAKE YOUR ASS CRACK AND I'LL FIND THAT GODDAMNED SONOFABITCH AND I'LL MAKE HIM PAY!!" AND I'VE TOTALLY FORGOTTEN IT WAS ME ON THE ROOF AND THE MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE IS LIKE "UHH, NO THAT'S OKAY!!" AND I'M LIKE "NO! NO! YOU GIVE US THOSE FRIES FOR FREE AND I'LL GET ON THE ROOF AND CATCH THAT DIRTY ROTTEN BASTARD OF A MAN AND I'LL -" AND THE MCDONALDS GUY IS LIKE "NO! NO! IT'S OKAY! IT'S OKAY! IT'S OKAY!" AND I'M LIKE "NO! YOU DON'T GET IT!" AND BRENT DRIVES OFF AND WE SAIL HOME INTO THE SUNSET AND THEN THE NEXT MORNING I HAVE TO WATCH THE VIDEO OF IT (WHICH BAR CONVENIENTLY TOOK) BEFORE I REMEMBER WHAT WAS GOING ON. 
ALRIGHT THIS ONE IS A LITTLE GROSS AND NOT THAT FUNNY, BUT STILL A STORY.
SO KYLE AND I ARE GOING CAMPING WITH KYLE'S PARENTS. AND I USE THE WORD "CAMPING" LOOSELY, BECAUSE WITH KYLE'S FOLKS THAT SHIT TRANSLATES INTO A CEMENT PARKING LOT WITH RUNNING WATER AND ELECTRICITY AND ALL THE AMENITIES OF HOME. IT'S CAMPING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AFRAID OF THE GREAT OUTDOORS.
SO WE PULL OFF THE HIGHWAY, PAY THE 20 DOLLARS OR WHATEVER TO PARK UNDER THE TARP, AND KYLE'S DAD SETS UP HIS BIG TRAILER AS WELL AS THE LITTLE TRAILER KYLE AND I SLEEP IN. WE LOVE THIS THING. IT'S TINY AND COZY AND HAS TWO BUNKS AND A LITTLE CARD TABLE AND A BUNCH OF SNACKS. EVERYTHING WE NEED.
NOW OF COURSE THERE'S NO PLACE TO SWIM IN THE CONCRETE PARKING LOT SO WHAT THE KIDS ARE FORCED TO DO WHILE LAZY ADULTS WATCH THEIR PORTABLE TV'S AND COMPLAIN ABOUT 'ROUGHING IT' IS SNEAK OUT AT NIGHT, WALK ABOUT A KILOMETER TO THIS OLD LADY'S HOUSE, AND SWIM IN HER POOL.
BECAUSE THIS OLD WOMAN IS SO CLOSE TO THE CAMP SITE, SHE'S GOT AN EXTRA HIGH FENCE TO KEEP OUT THE KIDS. IT'S GOT TO BE ABOUT 12 OR 15 FEET HIGH. SO WHAT THE KIDS WOULD DO IS THROW THEIR TOWELS OVER THE FENCE, CLIMB OVER IT AND JUMP DOWN TO THE OTHER SIDE. IT WAS A BIT OF A FALL BUT AT LEAST YOU COULD SWIM. ALSO I SHOULD MENTION IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GREEN-DIAMOND FENCES THAT ARE BASICALLY WIRE COATED WITH GREEN PLASTIC. AT THE TOP OF THE CROSSBAR THE WIRES ARE CUT SO YOU HAVE ALL THOSE LITTLE POINTY BITS STICKING UP AND THAT'S THE SECOND BIGGEST DANGER OF THE NIGHT. THE BIGGEST DANGER IS, OF COURSE, THE OLD WOMAN WHO OWNS THE HOUSE. RUMOURS ABOUND THROUGHOUT CAMP ABOUT HOW SHE'S JUST THE MEANEST EVILIST CRAZY OLD LADY ALIVE AND SHE'LL SHOOT AT YOU WITH HER B.B. GUN OR PUT SPELLS ON YOU OR MAKE YOU WATCH OPRAH WITH HER OR WHATEVER SCARY STORIES KIDS CAN MAKE UP ABOUT HER.
SO ONE NIGHT KYLE AND SNEAK OUT AND RUN TO THE FENCE. I'D LIKE TO SAY IT WAS A STARRY NIGHT OUT BUT BECAUSE OF ALL THE LIGHT POLLUTION YOU CAN'T TELL. WE GET TO THE FENCE AND THROW OUR TOWELS OVER. I CLIMB UP AND OVER AND JUMP TO THE OTHER SIDE. KYLE FOLLOWS SUIT, ONLY WHEN HE JUMPS DOWN I HEAR THIS TEARING NOISE.
KYLE LANDS ON HIS FEET AND DOESN'T MOVE. HE'S VERY ASHEN-FACED AT THIS POINT AND THERE'S A LARGE TEAR IN HIS BATHING SUIT. A LITTLE RIVULET OF BLOOD IS TRICKLING DOWN HIS LEG.
"JESUS CHRIST KYLE!" I WHISPER FIERCELY. "ARE YOU ALRIGHT?"
KYLE PULLS HIS SWIMMING TRUNKS OPEN A LITTLE BIT AND TAKES A FEARFUL GLANCE DOWN. "DAVE... DAVE..." HE STAMMERS, "I THINK I CUT MY BALLS OPEN!!"
THIS IS NOT WHAT I NEED TO HEAR RIGHT NOW. KYLE STARTS MAKING LITTLE BLUBBING NOISES AND I THINK HE'S CLOSE TO CRYING. I NEED TO KEEP HIM FROM DOING THIS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP THE CRAZY OLD LADY.
"KYLE" I HISS, "CAN YOU CLIMB BACK OVER THE FENCE?"
KYLE ISN'T EVEN LISTENING TO ME. HE'S STARING DOWN HIS SWIM SUIT AND STARTS SAYING "OH GOD DAVE, WHAT SHOULD I DO? SHOULD I JUMP IN THE POOL? SHOULD I JUMP IN THE POOL?". HE'S GETTING PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER SO OUT OF DESPERATION I SAY "YES!" IN HOPES THAT HE'LL BE TOO PREOCCUPIED BY SWIMMING TO REMEMBER TO CRY.
KYLE JUMPS INTO A POOL AND IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT A MILLISECOND BEFORE HE HITS THE WATER THAT I REALIZE IT'S PROBABLY VERY HEAVILY CHLORINATED AND IT MIGHT STING A LITTLE BIT. WHICH IT EVIDENTLY DOES. KYLE EMERGES FROM THE WATER SCREAMING LIKE A STUCK PIG. THIS IS ENOUGH FOR ME. I THROW MY TOWEL BACK OVER THE FENCE AND CLIMB BACK OVER TO SAFETY AS AN UPSTAIRS LIGHT IN THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE TURNS ON.
ONCE AGAIN I JUST KIND OF LEAVE KYLE FOR DEAD AND QUIETLY CRAWL BACK INTO THE TRAILER AND GO TO BED. LATER THAT NIGHT I'M WOKEN UP BY SCUFFLING NOISES, AND I UNLOCK THE DOOR. KYLE HOBBLES IN AND LIES ON HIS BUNK. I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE HE'S WEARING AN ADULT DIAPER.
"WHAT IN GOD'S NAME HAPPENED TO YOU?" I ASK IN ASTONISHMENT.
KYLE KIND OF LETS A TIRED SIGH ESCAPE FOR HIM AND LOOKS SADLY INTO THE CORNER OF HIS BUNK: "THAT OLD LADY.. SHE PUT IODINE ON MY SACK. IODINE, DAVE." HE LOOKS UP AT ME AND DESPITE THE POOR LIGHTING I CAN SEE THAT HIS EYES ARE VERY RED AND HE APPEARS TO HAVE AGED CONSIDERABLY. KYLE CONTINUES: "AND THEN, BECAUSE MY BATHING SUIT WAS RIPPED, SHE MADE ME WEAR THIS." KYLE POINTS DUTIFULLY AT THE ADULT DIAPER DRAPED AROUND HIS WAIST. "I HAD TO WAIT HOURS BEFORE I HAD ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO RUN BACK HERE. THANK GOD I DIDN'T RUN INTO ANYONE I KNOW" HE CONCLUDES WITH A BIT OF A SNIFF.
"WELL AT LEAST YOU'RE BACK HERE AND YOU CAN CHANGE" I BEGIN, BUT KYLE IS ALREADY ASLEEP.
THE NEXT MORNING KYLE'S DAD WAKES US UP AT 6AM FOR SOME SORT OF PANCAKE BREAKFAST, ONLY TO FIND HIS SON PRETTY MUCH NAKED EXCEPT FOR THE DIAPER. SINCE KYLE CAN'T TELL HIS DAD HE WAS IN THE POOL, HE TELLS HIS DAD INSTEAD THAT IT WAS A 'DARE', WHICH IS ALMOST JUST AS BAD IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. 
WHOA I FORGOT ABOUT THIS. I'LL HAVE TO THINK. OR MAYBE JUST END THE THREAD ON A HIGH NOTE. WELL NOT REALLY A HIGH NOTE. A REGULAR NOTE.
ACTUALLY ONE MORE
SO IN HIGHSCHOOL THERE WAS THIS DUDE NAMED PAT WHO ALWAYS FUCKING TALKED TO US ABOUT HOW MUCH HE LOVED THE ARMY AND HOW HE COULDN'T WAIT TO GET IN THE ARMY AND HOW HE WAS GOING TO KILL A HUNDRED MEN AND WAS GOING TO POLISH HIS GUN EVERY NIGHT ETC ETC ETC. 
SO ANYWAY EVERY GODDAMNED DAY IN HISTORY CLASS WE'D STARE BLANKLY AT OUR TEACHER AND LISTEN TO PAT DRONE ON AND ON ABOUT THE HELICOPTERS AND COVERT MISSIONS AND SHIT NOBODY CARED ABOUT, AND THEN THE BELL WOULD RING AND WE WOULD RUN OUTSIDE AND INTO THE WOODS WHICH IS WHERE WE WOULD PLAY EVERY DAY AT LUNCH.
WE'RE ABOUT 14 OR 15 AT THIS POINT, AND OBVIOUSLY LOVE RUNNING AROUND IN THE WOODS. THERE WAS THIS LITTLE CREEK THAT RAN THROUGH OUR FAVORITE SPOTS, AND OVER THE DECADES EXTREME SOIL EROSION HAD ALLOWED FOR THIS LITTLE STREAM TO CREATE A 15-FOOT DEEP GULCH. FROM ONE BANK TO ANOTHER WAS MAYBE A 10 FOOT JUMP, BUT IT WAS STILL KIND OF SCARY TO DO IT. AT SOME POINTS ONE BANK WOULD BE SEVERAL FEET HIGHER THAN THE OPPOSING ONE, AND THESE WERE ESPECIALLY FUN FOR JUMPING.
SO ANYWAY THERE'S THIS ONE SPOT WHERE ONE BANK WAS ABOUT 10 FEET HIGHER THAN THE OTHER, AND IT WAS A FORMIDABLE LEAP BUT FORTUNATELY THERE WAS SOFT CLAY ON THE OTHER SIDE TO HELP ABSORB THE SHOCK. THIS WAS OUR FAVORITE JUMPING SPOT. THERE IS REALLY NOTHING QUITE AS SATISFYING AS JUMPING ACROSS A GULCH AND FALLING ABOUT 15 FEET AND LANDING SAFELY IN SOFT MUD. YOU'D GET YOUR SHOES DIRTY BUT THAT WAS ABOUT IT.
ANYWAY GETTING BACK TO PAT, THE DUDE WAS SUCH A PUSSY. FOR SOMEONE WHO TALKED NONSTOP ABOUT TACTICS AND RATIONS, HE WAS ALWAYS CHICKENING OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE. WHENEVER WE DID A 'SCARY' JUMP HE WOULD ALWAYS GET LEFT BEHIND ON THE OTHER BANK, AND THEN WE'D CONTINUE ON OUR ADVENTURES AND PAT WOULD HAVE TO TURN TAIL AND EITHER GO BACK TO THE SCHOOL, OR RUN ALONGSIDE THE CREEK WITH US UNTIL HE COULD FIND A FALLEN TREE OR SOMETHING BRIDGING THE GAP.
SO ONE DAY WE DECIDE TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE FAVORITE SPOT. WE ALL JUMP AND LAND IN THE CLAY ON THE OTHER BANK. FOR SOME REASON I REMEMBER SCOTT JUST BARELY MADE IT ACROSS. OF COURSE IF YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE OTHER BANK, YOU FELL AN ADDITIONAL 10 OR 15 FEET INTO THE CREEK, WHICH IS ONLY A FOOT DEEP AT MOST. NOT FUN, VERY DANGEROUS.
SO ANYWAY WE ALL JUMP EXCEPT FOR PAT, WHO HAS BEEN MARCHING ALONG WITH US AND TALKING ABOUT CAMOFLAUGE. WHEN WE'VE ALL JUMPED WE LOOK BACK AT PAT WHO IS EYEING US SADLY AND HAS FINALLY SHUT UP. WE START TEASING HIM, URGING HIM TO JUMP.
PAT LISTENS TO OUR TAUNTS BUT NEVER TAKES HIS EYES OFF THE OTHER BANK. FINALLY HE SIGHS AND TURNS AROUND AND TRUDGES OFF IN THE OTHER DIRECTION BACK TO THE SCHOOL WITH AN AIR OF FINALITY. ONCE AGAIN HE HAS CHICKENED OUT.
WE ALL TURN THE OTHER WAY AND BEGIN TO WALK FURTHER INTO THE WOODS WHEN SUDDENLY WE HEAR THIS CRAZED YELL. WE ALL WHIP AROUND AND STARE AT THE OPPOSITE BANK. THE YELL IS GETTING LOUDER, AND IT'S DEFINITELY COMING FROM PAT.
BECAUSE THE BANK THAT PAT IS ON IS ABOUT 10 FEET HIGHER THAN US, WE CAN'T SEE OVER IT VERY WELL, SO FOR A GOOD 20 SECONDS WE JUST HEAR CRASHING AND RANDOM NOISE AND PAT'S YELLING GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER. I AM CONVINCED HE IS BEING CHASED BY A BEAR. I AM WRONG.
TURNS OUT PAT IS JUST FED UP WITH BEING A COWARD. HE COMES INTO VIEW LIKE A ROCKET AND BEFORE ANYONE CAN SAY ANYTHING HE TAKES THIS BARRELLING LEAP OFF HIS SIDE OF THE BANK. THEN FOR SOME REASON HE TUCKS HIS KNEES IN LIKE HE'S DOING A CANNONBALL OFF A DIVING BOARD. BECAUSE OF THIS, HE DEFINITELY MISSED OUR BANK BY A MATTER OF INCHES AND WE WATCH IN UTTER DISBELIEF AS PAT JUST KIND OF FALLS IN FRONT OF US AND DISAPPEARS FROM VIEW. 
A FRACTION OF A SECOND LATER THERE'S A SICKENING CRUNCH/SPLASH AS PAT HITS THE CREEK BOTTOM. WE'RE ALL STILL STANDING ON THE BANK AND NOBODY HAS MOVED YET, WHEN WE ALL SEE THIS LITTLE TINY SILVERY-WHITE THING KIND OF FLY UP OUT OF THE GULCH AND LAND RIGHT NEXT TO JAKE.
JAKE BENDS OVER AND PICKS UP THE LITTLE SILVERY-WHITE THING. IT'S DEFINITELY PAT'S GODDAMNED CANINE TOOTH. BECAUSE THAT IDIOT HAD HIS KNEES PULLED UP TO THE BITTER END, WHEN HE HIT THE GROUND HIS KNEE HIT HIS CHIN WITH SUCH FORCE THAT HE CRACKED OUT A TOOTH.
WE ALL RUSH OVER TO THE EDGE OF THE ESCARPMENT AND LOOK OVER. PAT'S LYING ON HIS SIDE COVERED IN MUD WITH A THIN TRICKLE OF BLOOD FLOWING OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND INTO THE STREAM. SOMEONE SAYS "PAT?" AND HE GROANS IN RESPONSE AND WE SPEND THE REST OF LUNCH PULLING HIS STUPID ASS OUT OF THE CREEK. 
ALRIGHT SO IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KYLE WOULD COME OVER EVERY MORNING AND EAT BREAKFAST WITH ME & MY SISTER AND THEN THE THREE OF US WOULD WALK TO SCHOOL TOGETHER.
ANYWAY THIS ONE TIME THERE'S ONE OF THOSE RANDOM FOOD DRIVES GOING ON AT OUR SCHOOL, AND EVERYONE'S SUPPOSE TO CHIP IN AND HELP OUT THE HOMELESS BY BRINGING IN AN ITEM OF NON-PERISHABLE FOOD. 
SO KYLE SHOWS UP ONE MORNING WITH THIS LITTLE CAN OF TUNA AND I MAKE A LITTLE MENTAL NOTE TO BRING SOMETHING SLIGHTLY BIGGER. I DON'T KNOW WHY. I WAS A VERY COMPETITIVE CHILD AND OH I DON'T KNOW WHY. ANYWAY KYLE'S WATCHING ME LIKE A HAWK WHILE WE EAT OUR OATMEAL AND HE NEVER LOWERS HIS GAZE. FOR SOME REASON I AM JUST VERY SURE THAT KYLE IS ALSO A LITTLE WORRIED THAT I AM GOING TO BRING SOMETHING BIGGER. AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW WHY. I JUST HAVE THIS FEELING.
SO AFTER WE FINISH BREAKFAST I CLIMB UP ONTO THE COUNTER AND OPEN UP THE CUPBOARDS AND START RUMMAGING THROUGH ALL THE VARIOUS CANS WE'VE GOT. KYLE IS NOW STARING AT ME LIKE HE'S STARVING, AND AS I PULL OUT THIS ENORMOUS CAN OF TOMATO SAUCE HIS LITTLE FACE FALLS LIKE HE'S JUST BEEN DRAFTED. ALTHOUGH NEITHER OF US HAVE SAID ANYTHING, WE BOTH KNOW THAT I HAVE WON. 
SO THE NEXT MORNING KYLE SHOWS UP AND HE'S GOT THE BIGGEST BOX OF CEREAL I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. IT'S ONE OF THOSE ENORMOUS ONES YOU BUY FROM THE BULK STORE AND IT'S PRACTICALLY THE SAME SIZE AS KYLE. HE SETS THE BOX DOWN AKWARDLY BY THE KITCHEN TABLE AND SITS DOWN TO THE TABLE WITH A GIANT SMILE. THROUGHOUT BREAKFAST KYLE ATTACKS HIS TOAST AND EGGS WITH CHEERFUL VORACITY AND I NOTICE HE DOESN'T SO MUCH AS BOTHER LOOKING IN MY DIRECTION. CLEARLY HE THINKS HE HAS TRUMPED MY EFFORTS.
SO AFTER BREAKFAST I CLIMB BACK UP TO THE COUNTER AND THROW OPEN THE CUPBOARD DOORS. THERE'S NOTHING EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE TO KYLE'S GIGANTIC CEREAL BOX AND AS I FRANTICALLY SEARCH THROUGH THE CUPBOARD CONTENTS KYLE'S SMILE JUST GETS WIDER AND WIDER. HE'S GOT ME BEAT.
SUDDENLY I HAVE A DIVINE MOMENT OF INSPIRATION AND RUN OFF INTO THE BATHROOM. KYLE FOLLOWS ME WITH INTEREST, AND LOOKS ON WITH UTTER DISMAY AS I STRUGGLE TO PULL OUT THIS ENORMOUS BULK BOX OF TAMPONS FROM UNDER THE SINK. I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THESE THINGS ARE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER, IT'S LARGER THAN KYLE'S GODDAMNED CEREAL BOX.
KYLE'S STILL RECOILING FROM THIS BOMBSHELL, AND WE BEGIN OUR WALK TO SCHOOL IN SILENCE. OUR RESPECTIVE CARGO IS MUCH TOO BIG FOR US, AND WE BOTH HAVE TO GRIP OUR DONATIONS WITH OUR ARMS OUTSTRETCHED. SINCE OUR STREET IS RIFE WITH YOUNG PARENTS, THE SIGHT OF TWO SMALL BOYS CLUMSILY WALKING UP A HILL WITH GIANT BOXES OF CEREAL AND TAMPONS CAUSES SEVERAL MOMS AND DADS TO STAND IN THEIR DOORWAYS AND SMILE AT THE SIGHT.
WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE HILL WHEN THE SILENCE IS SHATTERED BY MY MOM YELLING OUT 'DAVID!!!'. I STUMBLE AND TRY TO TURN AROUND, BUT MY VIEW IS OBSTRUCTED BY THE ENORMOUS BOX OF TAMPONS. I PUT THE BOX DOWN. MY MOM IS DEFINITELY RUNNING UP THE HILL AND LOOKS A LITTLE EMBARASSED.
"DAVID, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!" SHE HISSES AT ME.
"I'M BRINGING DONATIONS FOR THE HOMELESS!" I TELL HER IN NO QUIET VOICE. I AM FAIRLY CERTAIN I'M CAN'T GET IN TROUBLE FOR HELPING THE NEEDY, AND BESIDES, I LIKE ATTENTION JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER 8 YEAR OLD.
"OH.." MOM PAUSES FOR A SECOND AND CATCHES HER BREATH. "WELL, CAN'T YOU BRING SOMETHING ELSE?" SHE ASKS ME
"WHAT? WHY? I DON'T WANT TO BRING SOMETHING ELSE" I SAY DEFENSIVELY, QUICKLY GLANCING OVER AT KYLE. HE LOOKS HOPEFUL.
"WELL WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO BRING SOME FOOD?" MY MOM BARTERS, LOOKING UNEASILY AROUND HER AT THE THRONG OF PARENTS STANDING IN THEIR DOORWAYS.
I HOLD MY GROUND: "NO, I THINK THIS WOULD BE BEST"
"LOOK, LET ME JUST GET YOU A CAN OF SOUP INSTEAD" MY MOM PLEADS.
"NO!!!" I SHOUT IN PANIC, LOOKING APPREHENSIVELY AT KYLE. "WHY?!!" 
"JUST BECAUSE!" MY MOM TELLS ME URGENTLY.
"WHY!!!" I REPEAT, FALLING INTO THAT COMFORTABLE AND TESTED CHILD-PARENT DIALOGUE WE ALL KNOW SO WELL
"BECAUSE!!" MY MOM SAYS FEROCIOUSLY
"WHY!!!!!" I YELL OUT FOR THE THIRD TIME, REALLY GETTING DOWN TO THE MEAT AND POTATOES OF THE ARGUMENT
"BECAUSE I NEED THEM" MY MOM BELLOWS OUT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.
SHE THEN SNATCHES THE ENORMOUS BOX AND CARRIES IT TRIUMPHANTLY DOWN THE HILL WHILE KYLE AND I LOOK ON IN A BIT OF A BEWILDERED DAZE. 
ALRIGHT THIS ISN'T REALLY FUNNY BUT I JUST REMEMBERED IT AND IT'S PRETTY CUTE/AWESOME:
SO WHEN I WAS LIKE 4 I WENT WITH MY MOM TO DC TO VISIT MY GRANDMOTHER AND ONE DAY WE ALL WENT OUT TO THE PARK AND I LOST MY FUCKING TEDDY BEAR. I'M PRETTY SURE HIS NAME WAS 'BEARY' BUT ANYWAY I LEFT HIM ON ONE OF THOSE HORSES MOUNTED ON THAT GIANT INDUSTRIAL SPRING THAT LITTLE KIDS RIDE ON. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
SO I DIDN'T REALIZE MY BEAR WAS LOST UNTIL LATER THAT NIGHT AND WHEN I FOUND OUT I WAS SO SAD, AND LIKE I NEVER REALLY CRIED THAT MUCH AS A CHILD BUT I REMEMBER I WAS PRETTY TEARFUL ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY.
SO ANYWAY MY MOM DRAFTS UP THIS GODDAMNED 'MISSING TEDDY BEAR' POSTER AND GOES OUT EARLY THE NEXT MORNING AND FLIERS LIKE HALF OF DC. SERIOUSLY THE SWEETEST/MOST AWESOME THING EVER. WE NEVER FOUND THE BEAR, THOUGH. AND THEN WHEN I GOT HOME MY DAD WAS WAITING FOR ME - HE HAD BOUGHT MAYBE 40 DIFFERENT STUFFED ANIMALS AND HAD THEM ALL LINED UP AND TOLD ME MY MOM HAD CALLED AND TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT THE DISASTER AND HE KNEW I COULDN'T REPLACE 'BEARY' BUT HE HOPED MAYBE I COULD CHOOSE AN ANIMAL TO HELP ME THROUGH THE TOUGH TIMES!!
SO I ENDED UP CHOOSING THIS LAMB BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS A DOG AND I NAMED IT 'DOGGY' (CLEARLY THE EVENT HADN'T SAPPED MY CREATIVITY) AND THAT LAMB WENT EVERYWHERE WITH ME FOR THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO. 
ALRIGHT SO LIKE THIS ONE BEAUTIFUL SATURDAY MORNING I DECIDE TO CREATE THIS ELABORATE 'TREASURE HUNT' FOR KYLE. I THINK THIS WAS GRADE 4 BECAUSE I REMEMBER AROUND THE SAME TIME WE GOT TO DISSECT OWL PELLETS (OWL PUKE) IN CLASS BECAUSE WE HAD AN AWESOME TEACHER AND I DISCOVERED AN ENTIRE RAT SKELETON IN MY OWL PELLET. SO ANYWAY I'M ABOUT 9.
SO I'M UP BRIGHT AND EARLY AND HAVE FOREGONE THE USUAL SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS TO PLAN MY TREASURE HUNT. I GRAB A BUNCH OF JELLYBEANS FROM THE KITCHEN AND PUT THEM IN A MASON JAR AND BURY THE JAR IN THE GROUND AT THE VERY END OF OUR STREET, UNDER A BUNCH OF TIGER LILLIES.
THEN I GRAB A PAD OF PAPER AND START WRITING THESE LITTLE RIDICULOUS 'CLUES'. EACH CLUE BASICALLY JUST SAYS SOMETHING LIKE "THE NEXT CLUE IS IN A BIRD'S NEST IN A TREE BY THE DRIVEWAY" AND "THE NEXT CLUE IS UNDER A BIG ROCK BY THE RIVER" AND STUFF LIKE THAT. I SERIOUSLY MUST HAVE MADE ABOUT 150 OF THESE 'CLUES', AND THEN I WORKED BACKWARDS FROM THE CANDY TO PLANT THEM ALL OVER THE NEIGHBORHOOD. BY LUNCHTIME I HAD THEM ALL HIDDEN WITH THE FIRST 'CLUE' IN KYLE'S MAILBOX.
SO I GO OVER TO KYLE'S, EAGER FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT TO START. I ASK KYLE IF HE'S CHECKED HIS MAIL YET, WHICH ALONE SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THE GAME AWAY BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING A KID NEVER ASKS ANOTHER KID. HOWEVER KYLE'S A LITTLE, YOU KNOW, AND HE SEEMS TO THINK MY QUESTION IS AN ACCEPTABLE ONE AND WE AGREEABLY WALK DOWN HIS DRIVEWAY TO THE MAILBOX.
KYLE FINDS THE FIRST CLUE AND JUST FUCKING ERUPTS. "DAVE!!! DAVE!!!" HE YELLS AT ME. I HAVE COYLY STAYED A FEW FEET AWAY AND AM GUILELESSLY KICKING AT THE GRASS PRETENDING TO MIND MY OWN BUSINESS. "DAVE!! DAVE!!! LOOK AT THIS!!!"
SO I WALK OVER AT AN INTENTIONALLY SLOW PACE AND WATCH WITH PLEASURE AS KYLE JUMPS AROUND ALL OVER THE GODDAMNED PLACE. "IT'S GOT TO BE TREASURE!! IT'S GOT TO BE TREASURE!! JUST LIKE THAT BOOK WE'RE READING IN CLASS!!!"
"WHAT DOES IT SAY, KYLE!!" I ASK INNOCENTLY AND HE STUTTERS OVER THE FIRST CLUE. "GO TO THE.. WE GOT TO GO TO THE... TO THE POND IN BILL'S BACKYARD!!! WE GOT TO GO TO THE POND!!"
KYLE STARTS RUNNING FLAT OUT TOWARDS THE POND AND I FOLLOW HIM WITH A BIG SMILE. THIS IS GOING TO BE JUST GREAT. BY THE TIME I ARRIVE KYLE'S ALREADY KNOCKED IN ABOUT 8 ROCKS AND HAS KILLED A GOLDFISH LOOKING FOR THE NEXT 'CLUE', BUT OF COURSE HE EVENTUALLY FINDS IT AND WE'RE OFF ONCE MORE, THIS TIME TO THE DECK IN FRONT OF OUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE.
THE NEXT HOUR IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE THIS. OCCASIONALLY I'VE HIDDEN A 'CLUE' TOO WELL AND KYLE CAN'T FIND IT, BUT WHENEVER THIS OCCURS I MIRACULOUSLY STUMBLE ACROSS IT AND PICK UP THE SCENT AGAIN. KYLE IS PRACTICALLY WETTING HIMSELF HE'S SO EXCITED.
SO THE TREASURE HUNT TAKES US ALL OVER THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND AT ONE POINT WE'RE TURNING DOWN HEMLOCK STREET WHICH IS ABOUT 5 BLOCKS AWAY FROM WHERE WE LIVE. WE ROUND THE CORNER AND KYLE IMMEDIATELY FLOCKS TO THE STOP SIGN AND STARTS PAWING AROUND IN THE DIRT FOR THE NEXT CLUE. HE CAN'T FIND IT. AT THIS POINT I'M KIND OF STARTING TO FORGET MYSELF WHERE I'VE HIDDEN HALF OF THESE DAMN THINGS, AND ABSENT-MINDEDLY BEGIN TO SEARCH AROUND THE STOPSIGN WITH KYLE.
I SAY ABSENT-MINDEDLY BECAUSE I'M STARING DOWN THE STREET AT A GROUP OF ABOUT 4 OR 5 KIDS MY AGE WHO I DON'T KNOW, WHO SEEM TO BE AWFULLY EXCITED. THEY'RE RUNNING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE STREET TO ANOTHER, GROUPING TOGETHER HERE AND THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES AT A TIME UNTIL SOMEONE ISSUES A LOUD GLEEFUL SHOUT AND THEN THEY'RE OFF AGAIN. ALL THE WHILE THEY ARE GETTING FURTHER DOWN THE STREET AND DISAPPEARING FROM VIEW.
I SWEAR IT TAKES ME LIKE 5 MINUTES OF WATCHING THIS AND LISTENING TO KYLE'S STRANGE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE CLUE ("WHERE IS IT?!? WHERE IS IT?!?! MAYBE STOP-SIGN MEANS SOMETHING ELSE... HMMMM.. STOP... SIGN... MAYBE THE ROOF?") BEFORE I REALIZE THAT THOSE DAMN KIDS DOWN THE STREET HAVE LUMBERED ACROSS MY GODDAMNED TREASURE-HUNT AND ARE HOT ON THE TRAIL.
I ACT QUICKLY AND MAKE UP SOME SORT OF VERY IRRATIONAL REASONING: "KYLE!!! MAYBE THEY MEAN THE STOP-SIGN DOWN THE STREET!!" I SUGGEST WEAKLY. I'M THINKING AHEAD AS MANY CLUES AS I CAN - I NEED TO SOMEHOW HEAD OFF THOSE OTHER KIDS BEFORE THEY GET TO THE CANDY. 
WE RUN BY THE LITTLE GROUP THAT'S CAUSING ME SO MUCH DISTRESS. THEY'RE A GOOD 10 CLUES AHEAD OF US AND I REALIZE I NEED TO GET KYLE ON A DIFFERENT BLOCK ALTOGETHER IF THERE'S TO BE ANY HOPE OF US SALVAGING THE HUNT. I FEEBLY SUGGEST WE TRY ANOTHER STOP-SIGN OVER ON WALNUT STREET AND KYLE, THANK GOD, AGREES TO IT WITHOUT ANY QUESTIONING.
ON WALNUT STREET I PRETEND TO 'TRIP' AND BY DIVINE PROVIDENCE UNEARTH A NEW CLUE. KYLE IS ABSOLUTELY OVERJOYED. THE LAST 15 MINUTES HAVE EVIDENTLY BEEN EXTREMELY HARD ON HIM AND HE IS JUST TICKLED PINK TO BE BACK IN THE HUNT. I MYSELF CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL A LITTLE SMUG ABOUT MY QUICK THINKING. I CHUCKLE IN DELIGHT AT THE THOUGHT OF THE LITTLE TEAM OF GUMSHOES BACK ON HEMLOCK STREET COMING TO AN INEVITABLE DEAD END.
SO WE RESUME THE TREASURE HUNT, AND NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON, AS WE ARE APPROACHING THE END OF OUR STREET. WE HEAD DOWN PINE AVENUE AND TURN THE CORNER. KYLE'S FINDING ALL THE CLUES EASILY AND IS MORE EXCITED THAN ANYONE I'VE EVER SEEN. WE'RE ALMOST HOME FREE NOW, AND I'M ALMOST SAD MY LITTLE DISTRACTION IS COMING TO AN END.
SO KYLE IS ON THE LAST CLUE, WHICH SAYS SOMETHING TO THE EXTENT OF "TURN LEFT AND DIG UNDER THE TIGER LILLIES" AND WE ROUND THE VERY LAST CORNER AND ARE REWARDED WITH THE SIGHT OF CHRIS, THE FAT TUBBY KID DOWN THE STREET WHO NOBODY LIKES, SITTING IN THE DIRT EATING A BUNCH OF DIRTY JELLYBEANS AND SMACKING HIS LIPS IN ECSTACY.
KYLE LOOKS HEARTBROKEN. I AM JUST ABOUT READY TO KILL CHRIS BUT I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING FOR FEAR OF GIVING AWAY THE GAME. CHRIS LOOKS AT ME AND HIS LITTLE PIGGY EYES GLINT IN THE SUN. HE SHOVES ANOTHER HANDFUL OF JELLYBEANS INTO HIS CAVERNOUS MOUTH. 
"HEY DAVE!" I CAN ACTUALLY HEAR JELLYBEANS GETTING STUCK IN HIS BRACES. "I WATCHED YOU BURY THESE THIS MORNING FROM MY BEDROOM WINDOW. I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND." 
GOT REALLY DRUNK LAST NIGHT AS USUAL. WENT TO THE NEAREST LIQUOR STORE TO GET THERE 2 MINUTES AFTER IT CLOSED, DROVE ACROSS THE GODDAMNED CITY TO THE OTHER ONE THAT CLOSES AN HOUR LATER AND ALMOST FUCKED THAT UP TOO
THEN SOME DUDES GOT LOST IN QUEBEC, THE BARTENDER DID SHOTS WITH ME, THERE WAS A BIRTHDAY AND SOME CONFUSION AND I WAS ACCOSTED AT THE FALAFEL PLACE.
BY GOD I'M GOING TO TORCH THAT MOTHERFUCKER DOWN. 
OH GOD DAMMIT I FORGOT ABOUT THAT SHIT!!!
IT WASN'T MOONSTAR, THOUGH.. FUCK... OH GOD IT WAS 'MOONSHADOW'
THE TIME DAVE SECRETARY ALMOST GOT KILLED ON THE TRAIN TRACKS BECAUSE THAT GIRL NAMED HER STUPID VACATION HOME 'MOONSHADOW'
GOOD STUFF!!!
A SMALL BUT SLIGHTLY AMUSING TALE FROM THAT SAME DAY IS THAT A BUNCH OF DECIDED TO GO SWIMMING. EVERYONE'S JUMPING IN AND CHRIS IS COMPLAINING THAT EVERYONE HAS SWIMMING TRUNKS EXCEPT FOR HIM, AND ALL HE HAS IS HIS BOXER SHORTS. EVERYONE'S TELLING HIM TO JUST JUMP IN AS HE IS BUT CHRIS IS STEADFASTLY REFUSING. FINALLY KEVIN, WHO HAS TOLD EVERYONE SEVERAL TIMES HE IS NOT GOING IN THE WATER, LOOKS AT CHRIS AND SAYS HE'LL DONATE HIS JEANS IF CHRIS DOESN'T MIND SWIMMING IN THOSE. CHRIS CONSENTS AND KEVIN QUICKLY STRIPS DOWN TO HIS BOXER SHORTS. CHRIS PUTS ON THE JEANS AND JUMPS IN HAPPILY. THEN I KIND OF STROLL IN AND ASK KEVIN WHY THE HELL HE'S IN HIS BOXER SHORTS BUT NOT IN THE WATER YET. 
KEVIN TELLS ME HE'S NOT GOING SWIMMING, LOOKS AT CHRIS SWIMMING DOGGEDLY IN HIS LEGGINGS, AND THEN SAYS "YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS REALLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL"
YOU KIND OF HAD TO BE THERE. SORRY THIS WASN'T QUITE AS FUNNY AS I HAD HOPED, BUT I'M GETTING INTO THE BOOOOZE BECAUSE IT'S FRIDAY EVENING AND I GOT THE DAY OFF WORK.
WHO WANTS TO COME OVER HERE AND HANG OUT!! I HAVE SWEET CHRISTMAS MUSIC, "NOEL NOG" WITH RUM, A TON OF CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, A SWEET TREE, A GODDAMNED FIREPLACE WITH A MANTLE DECORATED WITH CARDS, CANDY CANES, AND A TON OF GREAT BOOKS! 
ALRIGHT SO I'M IN CLASS, GRADE 3, MY TEACHER IS MRS. MENEZOS AND SHE'S PRETTY BATSHIT AND IS TRYING TO TEACH US HOW TO LINEDANCE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE SUPPOSE TO BE LEARNING ABOUT THE PLANETS OR LONG DIVISION OR DOING REPORTS ON BEVERLY CLEARY STORIES. I'M LOOKING AT THE BIG POSTER ON THE SIDE WALL, IT'S GOT A LIST OF EVERYONE'S NAME IN THE CLASS AND BESIDE EACH NAME IS A LONG ROW OF GOLD STARS EARNED BY THAT PARTICULAR STUDENT, USUALLY FOR GETTING A GOOD MARK ON A TEST OR DOING PARTICULAR WELL AT AN ACTIVITY.
MY LINE OF STARS IS ABOUT AS LONG AS THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA AND THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL ANYONE'S GOING TO CATCH UP TO ME. I'VE SPENT MOST OF THIS YEAR MAKING SURE I'M WELL AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION (JEFF) BECAUSE MRS. MENEZOS SAID AT THE END OF THE YEAR THE STUDENT WITH THE MOST STARS WILL GET A SURPRISE. AND I LIKE SURPRISES.
SO ANYWAY I'M THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THIS WHEN THE INTERCOM SYSTEM GOES ON AND I'M CALLED TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE. THIS IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL - ONLY BAD STUDENTS GET CALLED TO THE OFFICE, AS YOU ALL KNOW, AND I'M ONE OF THE BEST STUDENTS IN SCHOOL. AN INQUISITIVE MURMUR RUNS THROUGH THE CLASS LIKE A COLD BREEZE AND I GET UP IN A BIT OF A PANIC AND GO OUT INTO THE HALL.
SCHOOL HALLS ARE QUIET AND EERIE WHEN CLASS IS IN, AND I'M NOT VERY PLEASED ABOUT ANYTHING. I WALK INTO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE. IT SMELLS LIKE THOSE PINK PEARL ERASERS AND HOT DOG BUNS WHICH IS ACTUALLY PROBABLY COMING FROM THE CAFETERIA. WHAT IS MOST NOTICEABLE, THOUGH, IS KYLE, WHO IS SITTING IN A CHAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM SOBBING UNCONTROLLABLY WHILE THE PRINCIPAL MRS. HEGGINBOTTOM TRIES TO CONSOLE HIM. SHE SEEMS POSITIVELY RELIEVED WHEN I ENTER THE ROOM AND EXPLAINS THE SITUATION.
"WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM - WE'VE CALLED HIS FATHER BUT HE'S NOT AT HOME, AND THE ONLY THING HE'S ASKED SO FAR IS TO SPEAK TO YOU."
THIS RINGS A VERY SMALL BELL. A YEAR AGO IN GRADE TWO THE SAME GODDAMNED THING HAPPENED, ONLY WITH MY SISTER - SHE HAD BEEN STUNG BY A BEE AND SPENT A SOLID HOUR IN THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE BLUBBERING AWAY AND GENERALLY PERPLEXING EVERYONE IN SIGHT UNTIL THE SECRETARY FINALLY WAS ABLE TO MAKE OUT THE WORDS "I.. WANT.. DAVE!!"
I GRIP KYLE BY THE SHOULDERS AND ASK HIM WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.
KYLE PAUSES SOBBING JUST LONG ENOUGH TO BLURT OUT "I WAS KICKED IN THE THROAT!"
A FAINT SMILE APPEARS ON MRS. HEGGINBOTTOM'S FACE AND SHE RELAXES A LITTLE BIT. I GUESS SHE NO LONGER THINKS THAT KYLE'S ON HIS DEATHBED.
"KICKED IN THE THROAT?" HEGGINBOTTOM IS BACK IN CONTROL; "WELL WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT! KYLE, WE'RE GOING TO CALL YOUR PARENTS AGAIN, AND WE'LL GET ONE OF THEM TO TAKE YOU HOME."
"TRY HIS STEP-MOM" I SUGGEST, KNOWING THERE'S A BETTER CHANCE SHE'S AROUND, "AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, JUST CALL MY MOM".
THE SECRETARY PICKS UP THE PHONE. SHE'S UNABLE TO GET THROUGH TO KYLE'S STEP-MOM, BUT MY MOTHER PICKS UP. UNFORTUNATELY SHE'S HEADING OUT FOR AN APPOINTMENT SHE CAN'T BREAK.
"PERHAPS DAVE CAN WALK KYLE BACK TO YOUR PLACE?" MRS. HEGGINBOTTOM SUGGESTS. KYLE'S STILL CRYING AND SHAKING AND CLUTCHING HIS THROAT LIKE HE WAS ATTACKED BY A WOLF AND I'M STARTING TO GET A LITTLE EXCITED THAT I MIGHT GET TO GO HOME.
MY MOM AGREES AND THE PRINCIPAL TELLS ME TO GET KYLE HOME AND TO BED. THIS LITTLE TALK WITH MRS. HEGGINBOTTOM HAS MADE ME FEEL LIKE I'M 12 YEARS AND TAKE THE REPONSIBILITY TO HEART. "COME ON, KYLE" I CROON GENTLY "LET'S GET YOU HOME AND ALL TUCKED IN."
KYLE AND I BEGIN OUR TREK HOME TO THE EVIDENT APPEASEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL AND SECRETARY. KYLE, SLIGHTLY MOLLIFIED BY MY COMPANY, HOBBLES ALONGSIDE ME, SNIFFING EVERY COUPLE OF SECONDS. I PUT AN ARM AROUND HIM AND GIVE MRS. HEGGINBOTTOM WHAT I HOPE TO BE A RESPONSIBLE, MOTHERLY SORT OF LOOK, AND OUT WE GO.
IT'S A 10 MINUTE WALK BACK HOME AND MOST OF IT IS ACCOMPLISHED ON A PATH THROUGH THE WOODS BEHIND THE SCHOOL. THE SECOND WE GET TO THE WOODS KYLE WIPES HIS EYES AND NOSE AND MIRACULOUSLY CONVALESCES RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES. "I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WORKED!!" HE SHOUTS IN AMAZEMENT.
I THINK AT THAT POINT IN TIME THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF SKIPPING SCHOOL WAS FOREIGN TO ME BECAUSE I REMEMBER REGARDING KYLE IN COMPLETE DISBELIEF. WE RESUME WALKING. I AM TOTALLY STUNNED.
KYLE'S BUOYANT AS EVER. "NOW WE HAVE THE DAY OFF!" HE STARTS WHISTLING AND DOES A LITTLE DANCE DOWN THE STREET IN FRONT OF ME. MY AMAZEMENT IS SLOWLY GIVING WAY TO ANGER AND I ADDRESS KYLE WITH AS MUCH ACRIMONY AS I CAN MUSTER.
"KYLE YOU MORON, I HAVE A TEST LATER TODAY AND IF I DON'T DO IT I'M NOT GOING TO GET A GOLD STAR AND YOU KNOW I NEED THOSE GOLD STARS!".
KYLE LOOKS AT ME WITH A HINT OF AMUSEMENT IN HIS FACE. WE'VE LEFT THE FOREST AND HAVE TURNED ONTO OUR STREET. SINCE IT'S WARM OUT WE BOTH TAKE OFF OUR SHOES AND WALK BAREFOOT. (WE ALWAYS DID THIS WALKING TO AND FROM SCHOOL). I'M GETTING ANGRIER BY THE MINUTE.
"NO, REALLY, KYLE, THIS ISN'T AWESOME AT ALL! I NEED TO DO THAT TEST! " I'M JUST FURIOUS NOW. KYLE'S PRETTY GOOD AT RECOGNIZING WHEN I'M ANGRY, AND HE LOOKS AT ME FOR ABOUT HALF A SECOND AND THEN TEARS DOWN THE STREET.
I START RUNNING AFTER HIM, SHOUTING OUT THREATS. KYLE PUTS ON AN EXTRA BURST OF SPEED AND ROUNDS THE CORNER TO HIS BACKYARD WHEN HE SUDDENLY CRUMPLES TO HIS SIDE. I QUICKLY CATCH UP TO HIM - HE'S HOLDING HIS FOOT. I TAKE A LOOK AND AM APPALLED - HE'S SPLIT HIS HEEL OPEN. THERE'S THIS FINE BLOOD-RED LINE RUNNING ALMOST RIDE DOWN THE CENTER OF HIS HEEL AND IT'S BEGINNING TO BLEED.
"KYLE, THIS DOESN'T LOOK VERY GOOD" I CONFESS. KYLE'S EYES ARE WELLING UP WITH TEARS AND IN A BIT OF A PANIC I SEE HE'S GETTING READY TO CRY AGAIN. I'M RIGHT. WITHIN MINUTES HE'S BAWLING AGAIN AND CLUTCHING HIS FOOT LIKE HE STEPPED IN A TRAP. I'M WONDERING HOW TO GET HIM HOME.
IT'S AT THIS EXACT MOMENT THAT KYLE'S STEP-MOM MAKES AN APPEARANCE. SHE'S DRIVING DOWN THE STREET IN HER CAR AND IS OBVIOUSLY A BIT CONFUSED AS TO WHY HER STEP-SON AND HIS BEST FRIEND ARE SQUATTING IN A DITCH BAREFOOT ON A SCHOOL DAY. SHE PULLS THE CAR OVER. SINCE KYLE'S ALWAYS CRYING SHE'S NOT TOO CONCERNED YET, AND ASKS ME WHAT'S GOING ON.
KYLE INTERRUPTS BEFORE I CAN SAY ANYTHING. "I WAS KICKED IN THROAT!!!" HE BAWLS OUT IN COMPLETE FRUSTRATION, STILL CLUTCHING HIS FOOT WITH BOTH HANDS AND LYING ON HIS BACK. "AND DAVE DID IT!".
THE REST OF THIS LITTLE EPISODE IS MERCIFULLY BLURRED. I REMEMBER I WAS SENT TO MY ROOM AND MY MOM WAS CALLED, AND I REMEMBER I WASN'T EXONERATED UNTIL A FEW CALLS TO THE SCHOOL WERE PLACED. EVEN THEN I SEEM TO RECALL GETTING A STERN TALKING-TO BECAUSE I CHASED KYLE. WORST OF ALL, I MISSED THE TEST AND JEFF GOT A GOLD STAR. 
I DID WIN THE GOLD STAR SURPRISE! IT WAS TWO THINGS:
FIRST, I GOT TO CHOOSE ANY BOOK I WANTED FROM THE MONTHLY SCHOLASTIC BOOK CATALOGUE-THING. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DUDES GOT THESE, BUT ONCE A MONTH SCHOLASTIC SENT OUT THESE PAPER 'CATALOGUES' THAT WERE ABOUT 3 PAGES LONG AND CONTAINED A BUNCH OF NEW BOOKS FOR KIDS. WE TOOK THEM HOME TO OUR PARENTS AND THEY'D GIVE US SOME MONEY TO BUY BOOKS WITH. THEN YOU'D FORGET ALL ABOUT THEM UNTIL A FEW WEEKS LATER WHEN YOU'D WALK INTO CLASS AND THERE'D BE SOME NEW BOOKS ON YOUR DESK! WHEN YOU ORDERED BOOKS THEY ALWAYS GAVE YOU SOME LITTLE EXTRA THINGS FOR FREE - LIKE BOOKMARKS AND PENCILS AND WE ALWAYS LOVED THAT SHIT. I REMEMBER GETTING THIS SWEET HALLOWEEN PENCIL WITH ALL THESE GHOSTS AND WITCHES ON IT. 
THE OTHER THING I 'WON': AT THE END OF THE YEAR OUR CLASS GOT TO GO TO THE MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, AND WHILE WE WERE THERE WE GOT TO WATCH THIS BIG PRESENTATION ON LIQUID NITROGEN. AT THE END OF THE PRESENTATION THE SCIENTIST TOLD US HE WAS GOING TO DUMP THE CANISTER OF NITROGEN ONTO THE CARPET, AND AFTER WE WAITED 15 SECONDS WE COULD GO TO THE CARPET AND FEEL ALL THE FROZEN STRANDS WHILE IT EVAPORATED. ANYWAY I GOT TO BE THE ONE WHO HELPED THE SCIENTIST DUMP THE CANISTER! I GOT TO WEAR THESE HUGE GLOVES AND I WAS THE FIRST ONE TO WATCH THE NITROGEN GUSH OUT OVER THE CARPET IN A BIG WHITE FOG AND IT WAS REALLY AWESOME. 
ALRIGHT VERY QUICKLY
SO KEVIN, MYSELF, AND THIS FOREIGN DUDE "PEET" (NOT PETE, PEET) FROM FRANCE ARE PLANNING AN EXCURSION TO STEAL GOLF BALLS FROM THIS VERY EXCLUSIVE FRENCH GOLF COURSE.
PEET'S AT SCHOOL WITH US (THIS IS HIGHSCHOOL, NOT COLLEGE - MY MISTAKE) BECAUSE FRANCE AND QUEBEC DO EXCHANGES ALL THE TIME. HOW HE GOT WEDGED INTO OUR SCHOOL I'LL NEVER KNOW BECAUSE PHILEMON WRIGHT IS PRETTY GHETTO AS FAR AS CANADIAN HIGHSCHOOLS GO. 
SO ANYWAY WE WALK TO THE GOLFCOURSE AND SNEAK OVER THE GATE AND DISAPPEAR INTO THE WOODS. IT'S A BRIGHT FALL DAY AND WE'RE PRETTY MUCH HIDDEN IN THE TREES AND THERE ARE GOLF BALLS EVERYWHERE. WE'VE BROUGHT LARGE BLACK GARBAGE BAGS WITH US. WE'RE SLOWLY MAKING OUR WAY TO THE DRIVING RANGE WHICH IS WHERE THINGS GET TRICKY. YOU HAVE TO RUN OUT INTO SIGHT OF THE GOLFERS, SECURITY, ETC, AND SCOOP UP AS MANY GOLF BALLS INTO YOUR BAG AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN. THIS CAN GET KIND OF DANGEROUS BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL THE GOLFERS TRY AND HIT YOU WITH BALLS FROM 300 YARDS, AND AS SOON AS YOU'RE SPOTTED BY SECURITY THEY START CHASING YOU DOWN AND YOU ONLY HAVE ABOUT A MINUTE BEFORE YOU NEED TO BAIL.
ONCE YOU'RE BACK IN THE WOODS SECURITY/RANDOM GOLFERS USUALLY STOP GIVING CHASE, AND YOU CAN CAREFULLY PICK YOUR WAY BACK TO THE GATES. THEN THE WHOLE PLAN IS TO TAKE YOUR SPOILS DOWN TO THE HIGHWAY AND START THROWING THEM AT CARS, BIKERS, PEOPLE, ETC. IT WAS A GOOD WAY TO PASS THE LUNCH-HOUR.
ANYWAY SO WE'RE IN THE WOODS HEADING TOWARDS THE DRIVING RANGE. 'PEET' IS ENTERTAINING US WITH HIS FRENCH ACCENT, TELLING US ABOUT THE TIME HE COULDN'T FIND HIS SHOES, WHEN WE HERE A SWISHING NOISE AND A GOLF BALL HITS THE TREE RIGHT IN FRONT OF KEVIN. WE STOP DEAD IN OUR TRACKS. FRENCH GOLFERS ARE NASTY PEOPLE AND A GOLF BALL CAN GIVE YOU A GODDAMNED CONCUSSION IF YOU AREN'T CAREFUL.
WE PAUSE AND HOLD OUR BREATH. IT'S UNLIKELY WE'VE BEEN SPOTTED SO QUICKLY, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE WOODS ARE SO DENSE. WE LOOK UP - ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS UP ON THE GREEN A GOLFER IS PEERING DOWN INTO THE WOODS WITH A GIANT FROWN. WE AREN'T SURE IF HE'S LOOKING AT US, OR IF HE CAN EVEN SEE US FOR THAT MATTER. MOST LIKELY HE JUST LOST HIS BALL AND IS SEEING IF THERE'S ANY HOPE OF RECOVERING IT. SOON THE GOLFER STEPS BACK OUT ONTO THE COURSE AND DISAPPEARS. PEET GIGGLES NERVOUSLY, GRABS THE GOLF BALL, THROWS IT INTO HIS SACK, AND WE MOVE ON.
ABOUT 4 MINUTES LATER ANOTHER GOLF BALL WHIZZES THROUGH THE AIR AND NEARLY BRAINS KEVIN. WE ALL PAUSE AGAIN AND QUICKLY LOOK UP. WE'RE A LOT CLOSER FROM THE GREEN THIS TIME AND IT'S THE SAME GODDAMNED GOLFER. WE'RE PRETTY SURE HE CAN SEE US, BUT NOT POSITIVE. HE'S DOING THE SAME THING - STARING DEEPLY INTO THE FOREST AND SCOWLING LIKE HE WAS JUST POKED IN THE BEHIND WITH A NEEDLE. WE DON'T MOVE UNTIL HE GIVES A LITTLE GRUNT OF DISSATISFACTION AND DISAPPEARS BACK ON THE GREEN. THIS IS GETTING WEIRD.
PEET PICKS UP THE BALL AND COMPARES IT TO THE ONE IN HIS BAG - IT'S THE SAME BRAND. THERE'S NO MISTAKE - THIS IS THE SAME GOLFER. "WHAT THE HELL IS HE PLAYING AT?" KEVIN HISSES AT ME. I SHRUG MY SHOULDERS.
"DEES IS DANGEROUS" PEET CLAIMS AND LOOKS AT US WISELY. WE ALL STARE AT EACH OTHER FOR A SECOND AND CONTINUE.
THIS TIME BARELY 10 SECONDS PASS BEFORE ANOTHER GOLF BALL SAILS THROUGH THE AIR AND NEARLY STRIKES ME DEAD. WE STOP ABRUPTLY AND STARE UP. THE GOLFER IS LOOKING RIGHT AT THE SPOT WHERE WE'RE STANDING BUT I GET THE IMPRESSION HE STILL CAN'T SEE US. SUDDENLY IT DAWNS ON ME; HE CAN HEAR US WHEN WE'RE MOVING, BUT HE CAN'T SEE US WHEN WE'RE MOTIONLESS. I QUICKLY RELAY MY MESSAGE TO KEVIN AND PEET AND THEY AGREE.
WE CONTINUE CAREFULLY FROM THAT POINT ON. EVERY SO OFTEN A BALL COMES HURTLING IN OUR DIRECTION, SOMETIMES DANGEROUSLY CLOSE, SOMETIMES WAY OFF. EACH TIME IS FOLLOWED BY THE IRATE GOLFER STARING PASSIONATELY INTO THE FOREST.
THE TENSION IS DEFINITELY MOUNTING. I PERSONALLY AM STARTING TO FEEL LIKE A FOX IN A HUNT AND I CAN TELL KEVIN AND PEET AREN'T MUCH BETTER OFF. PEET IN PARTICULAR IS STARTING TO LOOK A LITTLE OFF-COLOR AND HAS TAKEN TO SILENTLY SHAKING HIS FIST AT THE GOLFER EACH TIME HE MAKES AN APPEARANCE.
THE GOLFER, TOO, I'VE NOTICED, IS DEFINITELY TAKING A GREATER ACCOUNT OF THE SOUNDS COMING OUT OF THE WOODS, BECAUSE HE'S LOOKING LONGER AND LONGER EACH TIME HE SENDS A GOLF BALL OUR WAY.
THE CLOUDS BREAK WHEN A GOLF BALL ACTUALLY HITS PEET IN THE LEG. UNABLE TO CONTROL HIS FRUSTRATION, PEET YELLS OUT 'HEY, HEY YOU!!' AT THE GOLFER. "WHAT ARE YOU DO-EENG, HUH? QUIT THAT, WHY DON'T CHU! ESTI!"
EVEN THOUGH THE GOLFER IS A WAYS OFF, I CAN SEE THAT PEET'S LITTLE CRY OF INDIGNATION HAS STARTLED THE MAN. HE'S SPEECHLESS FOR A SECOND, AND THEN, IN AN ACCENT JUST AS FRENCH AND AS THICK AS PEET'S, THE GOLFER MAKES HIS OWN VOICE HEARD: "OH YOU STUPEED KIDS! I KNEW, I KNEW DER WAS SOMEONE IN DER!! OH YOU STUPEED KIDS!"
THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR PEET. "NO, NO! YOU'RE STUPEED!! YOU'RE STUPEED!"
THE GOLFER IS GETTING REALLY WORKED UP NOW. HE'S GOT HIS CLUB RAISED HIGH THE AIR LIKE HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A VIGOROUS POLO GAME, AND PEET'S LITTLE RANDOM DENIGRATING CRIES ARE JUST EXCITING HIM FURTHER. 
"YOU STUPEED KEEDS!! YOU TAKE ALL MY BALLS! I KNOW IT! YOU TAKE ALL MY BALLS.. YOU.. .YOU" THE GOLFER IS BREATHING HEAVILY, I CAN HERE IT FROM WHERE I'M STANDING. HE'S GOT SOMETHING ON HIS MIND AND IS EVIDENTLY PROCESSING THE BEST WAY TO SAY IT. KEVIN AND I HAVE BEEN SILENT THE ENTIRE TIME, WATCHING PEET AND THIS GOLFER BOIL UP INTO RESPECTIVE LITTLE BALLS OF RAGE. I CATCH KEVIN'S EYE FOR A SECOND AND HE GIVES ME A LITTLE GRIN. I'M RELATIVELY SURE HE'S THINKING THE EXACT THING I AM, WHICH IS THAT BOTH PARTIES ARE SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER IN ENGLISH WHEN THEY'RE BOTH SO CLEARLY FRENCH. THAT OR THE FACT THAT WE MIGHT BE WITNESSING THE TWO ANGRIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.
"YOU KEEDS.. YOU STUPEED KEEDS.. YOU.. YOU.." CONTINUES THE GOLFER. HE FIGURES OUT WHAT HE'S DRIVING AT: "YOU PROFIT FROM MY SUCK!".
KEVIN HAS TO LAUGH AT THIS AND I DON'T BLAME HIM. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME KEEPING IT IN MYSELF. I'M STILL STAGGERED THAT THIS MAN HAS BEEN 'ACCIDENTLY' HITTING SO MANY GOLF BALLS INTO THE WOODS. I'M JUST ASTONISHED THAT HE WASN'T 100% SURE WE WERE THERE.
BUT BEST OF ALL IS PEET'S REPONSE. HE'S JUST ENRAGED BEYOND MEASURE AT THIS POINT AND IS SHAKING BOTH FISTS IN THE AIR LIKE A SHAMAN. "I DON'T WANT YOUR SUCK!!!" HE SCREAMS OUT, BARELY AWARE OF WHAT HE'S SAYING, "I JUST WANT YOUR BALLS!! AND NOW I HAVE THEM!!"
WITH THAT PEET SLINGS HIS NEARLY-EMPTY GARBAGE OVER HIS SHOULDERS AND RUNS BACK INTO THE WOODS. KEVIN AND I FOLLOW HIM, NEARLY DOUBLED OVER WITH LAUGHTER, AND THE LAST THING WE HEAR IS THE GOLFER SCREAM (AND I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP) "YOU WON'T GEET AWAY WITH DEES!!!!" 
AT MACROCK, BILL OR STEVE (I ACTUALLY CAN'T REMEMBER BECAUSE I WAS PRETTY DRUNK MYSELF), TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WAS HEADING BACK TO OUR VAN TO GO DRINK QUIETLY BY HIMSELF. SO HE FINDS THE VAN PARKED UNDER A TREE SOMEWHERE AND CLIMBS IN, SHUTS THE DOOR, AND STARTS DRINKING. ABOUT A MINUTE LATER HE REALIZES THAT CHRIS, WHO APPARENTLY CRAWLED OUT FROM UNDER THE SEAT, HAS BEEN IN OUR VAN ALONE FOR GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW LONG, DRINKING QUIETLY BY HIMSELF. 
ALRIGHT SO WE'RE IN CLASS AND THE TEACHER IS TALKING ABOUT HOW ANY ACTUAL EVENT HAPPENING IS ALWAYS STRONGER THAN THE MEMORY. WHICH MAKES SENSE TO ME. BUT APPARENTLY THIS ONE 50-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IN OUR CLASS IS HAVING DIFFICULTY WRAPPING HER HEAD AROUND THE CONCEPT, BECAUSE SHE PUTS UP HER HAND AND SAYS, "I DON'T UNDERSTAND!"
SO THE TEACHER SAYS, "OKAY, WELL WHEN SOMETHING ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO YOU, THAT EXPERIENCE IS SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER THAN A LATER MEMORY OF THE EVENT"
AND THE 50-YEAR-OLD TUGS ON HER JOGGING PANTS AND CLAIMS SHE STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.
THE TEACHER SIGHS AND SAYS, "ALRIGHT - THE PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS ARE JUST OVER THAT HILL. NOW YOU'VE ALL BEEN THERE MANY TIMES. IF YOU WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE CENTER BLOCK, AND I ASKED YOU HOW MANY WINDOWS THERE WERE, YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL ME. IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A LITTLE WHILE TO COUNT THEM ALL, BUT YOU COULD TELL ME HOW MANY WINDOWS THERE WERE."
TEACHER TAKES A QUICK BREATH AND CONTINUES, THIS TIME DIRECTING HIS LITTLE MONOLOGUE AT THE 50-YEAR-OLD. "OKAY, SO NOW WE'RE SITTING HERE IN THE CLASS, AND PARLIAMENT IS JUST OUT OF SIGHT. NOW FROM MEMORY CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY WINDOWS THERE ARE IN THE CENTER BLOCK?"
AND THE 50-YEAR-OLD SCREWS UP HER FACE AS THOUGHT SHE'S THINKING DEEPLY AND SHE SAYS IN THIS EARNEST VOICE, "OH I SHOULD KNOW THIS!!!" 
ALRIGHT SO IN SCOUTS THIS ONE WINTERY DAY EVERYONE HAD TO GET UP AT ABOUT 4AM AND OUR PARENTS HAD TO DRIVE US ALL TO THE PARKING LOT BEHIND THE BOWLING ALLEY. WE ALL GOT THERE AROUND 4:30 AND WERE GREETED BY "AKELA" AND "BALOO" AND ALL THOSE LOSER SCOUT-LEADERS. APPARENTLY THE TASK FOR THE DAY WAS TO BUILD UP A 'FLOAT' FOR THE LITTLE AYLMER PARADE (AYLMER WAS THE TOWN I GREW UP IN), WHICH CAN BE INTERPRETED AS DECORATING THE FLATBED OF AN 18-WHEELER USING SNOW, BRANCHES, AND WHATEVER LITTLE TRINKETS THE SCOUT-LEADERS BROUGHT FROM THE DOLLAR STORE OR THEIR PARENT'S BASEMENTS.
SO WE'RE SHOVELING SNOW ON THE FLATBED AND PACKING IT DOWN AND EVERYTHING'S KIND OF BORING. WE'RE ALL JOKING AROUND BUT MOST OF US CAN'T WAIT TO GET THIS OVER WITH AND GO TO THE BOWLING ALLEY WHERE OUR PARENTS WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BUY US HAMBURGERS AND HOTDOGS, HOPEFULLY AROUND NOON.
THE SUN RISES AND THE CAMP LEADERS DOLE OUT SOME CHEAP TRAIL-MIX TO EVERYONE AND TELL US SOME ABJECT TALE ABOUT FOOD ENERGY. WE'VE ALMOST COVERED THE FLATBED WITH SNOW, AND A FEW OF US ARE MAKING LITTLE SNOWHILLS AND OTHER THINGS TO TRY AND VARY IT UP.
IT'S ABOUT THIS TIME THAT "BALOO" EXCITEDLY TELLS US HE'S GOT A HUGE SURPRISE FOR US, WHICH HE WILL SHARE IN AN HOUR. SO WE WORK A LITTLE MORE FEVERISHLY, SLAPPING PINE BRANCHES OVER THE SNOW AND TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A SCENE FROM A TRANQUIL WOODS OR SOMETHING. THE HOUR PASSES QUICKLY AND SOON WE ARE ALL LOOKING OVER AT "BALOO". HE HOLDS OUT AS LONG AS HE CAN AND THEN FINALLY EXPLODES "YOU BOYS ARE GOING TO RIDE ON THE FLOAT!! NOT JUST MAKE IT!!"
I THINK SCOTT MUMBLED "WHAT THE FUCK" BUT I COULDN'T BE SURE, BUT ANYWAY, NOBODY IS VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. 'RIDING THE FLOAT' TRANSLATES TO 10 HOURS OF SITTING ON THE FLATBED, WAVING AT RANDOM WELFARE FAMILIES IN FREEZING CANADIAN WEATHER. INSTANTLY THE ATMOSPHERE BECOMES A LITTLE TENSE AS EVERYONE LETS THIS NEW KNOWLEDGE SINK IN.
I NOTICE A FEW KIDS TALKING QUIETLY TO THEMSELVES AND WAIT AS THE NEWS SLOWLY PASSES TO WHERE I AM. APPARENTLY SEVERAL SCOUTS HAVE DECIDED TO QUIT WORKING ON MAKING THE FLOAT "PRETTY", AND INSTEAD ARE CARVING HOLES INTO THE SNOWHILLS ON THE FLATBED SO THAT THEY HAVE A WARM AND COZY NOOK TO HIDE IN DURING THE PARADE. I FIND THIS TO BE A CAPITAL IDEA, AND PRETTY SOON ALL US ARE STANDING ON THE FLOAT, DIGGING DOWN INTO THE COMPACTED SNOW WE HAD SO CAREFULLY SHOVELLED ON JUST HOURS AGO. 
WITHIN AN HOUR THE BASE OF THE FLOAT RESEMBLES A PIECE OF SWISS CHEESE; THERE ARE LITTLE HOLES ABOUT 3 FEET DEEP EVERYWHERE, SERIOUSLY COMPRIMISING THE STRUCTURE AND TENACITY OF THE BASE. MOST OF THE SCOUTS ARE TRYING TO "CAMOFLAUGE" THEIR HOLES BY DRAPING BRANCHES OVER THE HOLES, SO THAT THE CAMP LEADERS, WHO HAVE DISAPPEARED FOR THE LAST LITTLE WHILE, DON'T SEE THEM UNTIL WELL AFTER THE PARADE HAS STARTED.
THE COUNSELORS ARRIVE IN A BEAT-UP CAR, AND PULL THIS GIANT OBJECT OUT OF THE BACKSEAT. THEY UNFURL THIS ENORMOUS BANNER THAT SAYS "AYLMER CUB SCOUTS RULE!!!" AND A COUPLE OF GIANT POSTS TO HANG EACH END OF THE BANNER. WE ALL GROAN INWARDLY A LITTLE BIT BUT RESIGN OURSELVES TO OUR FATE. "THIS WILL BE OUR CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT!!" YELLS OUT BALOO IN WHAT I DETERMINE TO BE FRANTIC HYSTERIA - THAT DUDE ALWAYS GOT SO WORKED UP OVER NOTHING.
WE THROW ON A FEW EXTRA BRANCHES AND ARE EACH GIVEN A SMALL HORDE OF CANDY CANES TO THROW AT THE WELFARE FAMILIES. OF COURSE MOST OF THEM ARE GONE WITHIN MINUTES, BUT NOBODY REALLY CARES ABOUT THAT. THE CAMP LEADERS ARE PRACTICALLY WETTING THEMSELVES AS THEY MOUNT THE FLATBED. MIRACULOUSLY THEY EITHER DON'T SEE ALL THE HOLES, OR DON'T CARE.
THEY PLACE THEIR TWO POSTS FIRMLY IN THE COMPACTED SNOW, AND STRING THE "AYLMER CUB SCOUTS RULE!!!" BANNER ACROSS THEM, AND IT LOOKS REALLY REALLY BAD. IT'S ALMOST 10AM, AND THE PARADE IS ABOUT TO START. THE TRUCK DRIVER SHOWS UP AND "BALOO" YELLS, "ALL ABOARD!!" OR SOMETHING EQUALLY DUMB AND WE ALL CLIMB UP ONTO THE FLATBED.
THE LEADERS GET IN THE FRONT WITH THE TRUCK DRIVER AND WE'RE OFF AT 5MPH. WE WAIT UNTIL WE'RE ON THE MAIN ROAD AND ARE FIRMLY LODGED BETWEEN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LEFTOVER FLOAT FROM THE SANTA-CLAUS PARADE, AND THE BOOKMOBILE FROM SCHOOL. WE CAN SEE A FEW FAMILIES OFF IN THE DISTANCE, WAVING LIKE LUNATICS.
AS SOON AS WE APPROACH A THIN HERD OF BYSTANDERS WE DECIDE IT'S COLD ENOUGH AND EVERYONE MAKES A DASH FOR THEIR SNOW-HOLE. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THIS MUST HAVE LOOKED LIKE TO ANYBODY ON THE STREET - ONE MINUTE THERE'S A FLOAT WITH A DOZEN YOUNG BOYS ON IT, THE NEXT MINUTE THERE'S NOTHING BUT BRANCHES AND A SIGN ABOUT HOW "AYLMER CUB SCOUTS RULE!!". OH, AND THERE'S ADRIAN.
ADRIAN, YOU SEE, GOT TOTALLY FUCKED ON THE DEAL, BECAUSE WHEN THE SCOUT LEADERS PUT UP THE POSTS FOR THE BANNER THEY LODGED ONE OF THEM RIGHT IN HIS SNOWHOLE, EFFECTLY BLOCKING IT. SO HE'S RUNNING AROUND LIKE A SCARED RABBIT, TRYING TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS EXTRA ROOM IN THEIR HOLE. OF COURSE NO ONE IS WILLING TO SHARE.
HIS FIRST PLAN FAILED, ADRIAN THEN DECIDES TO PULL THE POST OUT OF HIS HOLE. SO HE THROWS HIS LITTLE BODY AGAINST THE POST AND LIFTS IT UP WITH ALL HIS MIGHT - IT'S NOT THAT HEAVY AND HE GETS IT OUT. OF COURSE IT TOPPLES OVER THE THAT'S THE END OF THE BANNER. I LOOK OVER AT THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK, AND CAN SEE "BALOO", LOOKING ABSOLUTELY APPALLED, AND MAKING THESE RIDICULOUS 'LIFTING' GESTURES WITH HIS HANDS. 
ADRIAN FOR SOME REASON DECIDES TO COMPLY, AND GETS THE POLE BACK UPRIGHT. THE BANNER CATCHES IN THE WIND AND ONCE AGAIN THINGS LOOK KIND OF NORMAL - ONLY NOW ADRIAN NEEDS TO MAKE A NEW HOLE FOR THE POST.
HE DECIDES, FOR WHATEVER REASON, TO MAKE THIS CLOSER TO THE CENTER OF THE FLATBED. HE'S HOLDING THE POST WITH BOTH HANDS AND IS STABBING IT DOWNWARDS THROUGH THE COMPACTED SNOW. IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH SOME ICE WITH A LOG OR SOMETHING. HE LOOKS RIDICULOUS, AND I KIND OF HUNCH DOWN IN MY HOLE SINCE THE WIND IS GETTING PRETTY FIERCE.
MY VIEW OBSCURED, I CAN NOW ONLY HEAR ADRIAN POUNDING THE POST DOWN THROUGH THE SNOW. IT'S SOUNDING REALLY LOUD, AND THEN SUDDENLY I HEAR THE SMACKING SOUND AS THE POST HITS THE WOODEN BOTTOM OF THE FLATBED, FOLLOWED BY THIS ENORMOUS "WHOOOOSH" AND THEN A LOT OF YELLING.
I QUICKLY STAND UP IN MY HOLE AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON - WHEN ADRIAN BROKE THROUGH TO THE BOTTOM WITH THE POST, THE WHOLE BACK HALF OF THE FLOAT SEPARATED AND FELL OFF THE FLATBED. SERIOUSLY WEAKENED BY THE SNOWHOLES, THE COMPACTED SNOW JUST SORT OF GAVE WAY AND SLID RIGHT OFF. OF COURSE THERE WERE SEVERAL KIDS IN THE BACK OF THE FLOAT WHO FELL OFF WITH THE SNOW AND THE BRANCHES AND IT'S A WONDER THAT THEY WEREN'T ALL CRUSHED TO DEATH BY THE BOOKMOBILE BUT NOBODY WAS SERIOUSLY HURT. I REMEMBER A BUNCH OF FAMILIES AND PEOPLE ON THE SIDEWALKS RAN OUT AND STARTED PICKING LITTLE CUB SCOUTS OUT OF THE SNOW AND RUNNING BACK TO THE SIDEWALKS WITH THEM, AND I REMEMBER ADRIAN STANDING THERE HOLDING THAT POST LIKE HE HAD JUST LANDED ON THE MOON AND IT WAS THE US FLAG, AND I REMEMBER BALOO LOOKING ABSOLUTELY STUNNED BY THE WHOLE THING. 
ALRIGHT SO ONE BRIGHT SUMMER MORNING KYLE AND I DECIDE TO OPEN UP A LEMONADE STAND. WE DRAG THIS GIANT COOLER OUT OF MY BASEMENT AND RANSACK OUR FRIDGES FOR LEMONS AND SUGAR, AND WE GET THIS GIANT PITCHER AND A BUNCH OF ICE, AND THEN WE TREK OUTSIDE TO THE CORNER OF MY STREET TO SET UP SHOP.
"SHOP" BASICALLY INVOLVES THIS TERRIBLY UNSAFE, RATTY STRUCTURE KYLE AND I HAD BUILT FROM THE REMAINS OF A ROTTEN FENCE. ORIGINALLY WE HAD MEANT TO BUILD A CLUBHOUSE BUT WE QUICKLY RAN OUT OF WOOD AND WE ENDED UP WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE A SORT OF STAND. REALIZING THIS, WE QUICKLY TURNED IT INTO A STAND, WHICH IS WHERE THE LEMONADE SELLING PLANS CAME INTO PLAY.
SO ANYWAY WE'VE TRUCKED OUT OUR STUPID 'STAND' AND PROP IT AGAINST THE COOLER AND ANNOUNCE WE'RE OPEN FOR BUSINESS. IT'S LIKE 8:00AM ON A SATURDAY MORNING AND WE'RE MISSING ALL THE GOOD CARTOONS FOR THIS. AND NOBODY'S EVEN AWAKE YET.
OF COURSE OUR FIRST COUPLE OF 'CUSTOMERS' ARE OUR PARENTS. THEY ACT ALL AMUSED AND PATRONIZE US FOR A WHILE, 'HAGGLING' WITH OUR PRICES, ETC. I DEFINITELY REMEMBER OUR PRICE FOR A GLASS OF LEMONADE BEING 5 CENTS, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS, EVEN BACK IN THE 80s. ANYWAY SO WE POCKET A FEW QUARTERS FROM OUR PARENTS AND ARE PRETTY PLEASED WITH OURSELVES. KYLE'S DAD BRINGS US SOME MORE LEMONS BECAUSE WE'RE OBVIOUSLY SQUEEZING THEM BY HAND AND GETTING LEMON JUICE EVERYWHERE AND IT'S TAKING LIKE 4 LEMONS JUST TO MAKE ONE GLASS.
THEN THINGS SORT OF SLOW DOWN FOR ABOUT 40 MINUTES, AND WE ALMOST MAKE A SALE TO AN UNUSUALLY SUSPICIOUS OLD MAN WALKING HIS DOG. HE ACTUALLY DECIDES TO PASS ON A GLASS OF LEMONADE FROM SOME CHILDREN OPERATING A STAND, AFTER GRILLING US FOR ABOUT OUR PRACTICES FOR NEARLY TEN MINUTES. UNREAL. WE'RE GETTING DEJECTED.
ANYWAY AFTER SOME SERIOUS TALKS, WE DECIDE WE NEED A GREATER VARIETY OF GOODS TO SELL, SO KYLE RUNS HOME AND RETURNS WITH A BOX FULL OF LARGER GLASSES, A LOAF OF BREAD, AND HIS STUPID PLASTIC BUBBLEGUM MACHINE WHICH IS FILLED WITH BUBBLEGUM.
NOW WE'VE GOT A REALLY LEGITIMATE BUSINESS RUNNING - CUSTOMERS HAVE TO DRINK THEIR LEMONADE AT OUR STAND BECAUSE WE CAN'T GIVE AWAY THE GLASSES, WE'RE RUNNING BACK HOME EVERY 20 MINUTES TO WASH THEM, KYLE'S OFFERING A FREE SLICE OF BREAD WITH PURCHASE OF LEMONADE IN SOME SORT OF BIZARRE MARKETING INCENTIVE, AND WE'RE SELLING BUBBLEGUM FOR 5 CENTS AS WELL. HOWEVER WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING MORE BUSINESS, AS BEMUSED ADULTS WANDER BY OUR LITTLE STAND AND SMILE AT THE CARNIVAL OF INDUSTRY WE'VE CREATED.
SPURRED BY THE SUCCESS, KYLE AND I RUN BACK HOME AND GRAB MORE GLASSES, AND MORE BREAD, AND OTHER RANDOM THINGS WE CAN FIND IN OUR KITCHEN. KYLE HAS LADEN HIS LITTLE WAGON WITH CONDIMENTS AND HAS THAT NEXT TO THE STAND, IN CASE ANYONE WANTS SOME KETCHUP OR VINEGAR WITH THEIR LEMONADE OR BREAD. I AM PUTTING JELLO POWDER IN THE LEMONADE. THINGS ARE GOING BRILLIANTLY.
THEN WE HIT A SMALL SNAG - WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF GUM (WHICH IS SELLING WELL) AND KYLE WANTS THE REST FOR HIMSELF. SO WE DECIDE TO DO A RAFFLE. KYLE RUNS AND MAKES 'TICKETS' AND I MAKE A SIGN STATING THAT ANYONE GUESSING THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF GUM BALLS IN THE MACHINE WILL WIN A FREE LEMONADE. TICKETS ARE 25 CENTS, 5 TIMES THE PRICE OF A LEMONADE.
MORE CUSTOMERS ARE COMING IN AND KYLE AND I HAVE PROBABLY MADE AT LEAST A DOLLAR AT THIS POINT. SEVERAL CUSTOMERS ASK US WHEN THE WINNER WILL BE ANNOUNCED FOR THE GUMBALL RAFFLE, WITH A HINT OF A SMILE, AND KYLE AND I REALIZE WE HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT THIS ONE THROUGH. "LATER", WE REPLY. "LATER - JUST STOP BY LATER AND WE'LL TELL YOU IF YOU'VE WON."
KYLE NOW HAS ANOTHER STROKE OF GENIUS AND RUNS HOME AND DONS HIS CUB SCOUT UNIFORM. MINE IS UNFORTUNATELY AT MY GRANDPARENTS PLACE (ANOTHER STORY), AND I SERIOUSLY FEEL REALLY LEFT OUT BECAUSE KYLE HAS HIS SCOUT UNIFORM ON AND I'M IN MY NINJA TURTLE SHORTS AND RED TSHIRT WITH A PICTURE OF FRENCH FRIES ON THE FRONT. NONETHELESS, WE ARE NOW SCOUTS SELLING LEMONADE AND HAVE A RENEWED SENSE OF WELL-BEING AND PURPOSE IN OUR LEMONADE-SELLING BUSINESS.
TIME PASSES AND BUSINESS SLOWS DOWN. LUNCHTIME COMES AND AS THERE HAVE BEEN NO CUSTOMERS FOR AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR, KYLE AND I HUNKER DOWN INTO OUR STORES AND EAT ALL THE BREAD, AND ALL THE GUM, AND FINISH OFF THE LAST OF THE LEMONADE. IT IS DELICIOUS.
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, SOME GODDAMNED JERK-ADULT COMES WALTZING UP THE STREET WITH A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE. HE'S HOLDING HIS RAFFLE TICKET AND IS CLEARLY BACK TO TEASE THE CHILDREN SOME MORE.
"ANNOUNCED THE WINNER, YET?" HE SAYS, ALL SMILES. KYLE AND I STARE AT EACH OTHER IN HORROR, AS THERE IS NO MORE LEMONADE. OR GUMBALLS. AND WE DIDN'T EVEN COUNT THEM. 
I STALL. "YES, BUT THE ANSWER IS WRITTEN AT HOME - KYLE WILL GET IT." THEN I HISS AT KYLE TO RUN HOME, WRITE DOWN A NUMBER - ANY NUMBER - ON A PIECE OF PAPER, AND GRAB A BUNCH OF LEMONS"
KYLE RUNS OFF AND I AWKWARDLY TRY TO FORM SOME SORT OF CONVERSATION WITH THE ADULT, TELLING HIM ABOUT HOW GOOD BUSINESS IS, AND HOW I THINK THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER LEMONADE STAND A FEW BLOCKS OVER (I WANT HIM TO GO). HE'S MAKING ALL THESE DUMB JOKES ABOUT HOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PAY TAXES, ETC ETC, WHEN I SPOT KYLE, RUNNING BACK TO ME EMPTY HANDED AND LOOKING SCARED.
KYLE GETS BACK, AND PAYS NO ATTENTION TO OUR CUSTOMER. "DAVE!!!" HE HISSES IN A VERY AUDIBLE TONE, "THERE AREN'T ANY LEMONS LEFT!!! WE'RE OUT OF LEMONS!!!!"
AT THIS THE ADULT GIVES US A BIG BENEVOLENT GRIN AND IS CLEARLY HAVING A GOOD TIME. KYLE LOOKS AT HIM IN UTTER HORROR, AND THEN TURNS TO HIS RIGHT TO SEE ANOTHER ADULT WALKING UP THE STREET, HOLDING ANOTHER RAFFLE TICKET HIGH UP IN THE AIR.
THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR KYLE. WE'RE BOTH PRETTY SCARED THAT WE'VE PROMISED SOMEONE A FREE LEMONADE AND DON'T HAVE ANY LEMONS LEFT, BUT KYLE JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT. HE TAKES ONE MORE WILD GLANCE AT THE ADULT IN FRONT OF HIM, AND AT THE ONE MOSEYING UP THE DRIVE, AND THEN YELLS "GET OUT OF HERE!!!" AT ME, AND TEARS DOWN THE STREET IN HIS CUB SCOUT UNIFORM.
BARELY A SECOND GOES BY WHEN I SEE KYLE'S STEP-MOM DRIVE AROUND THE CORNER. SHE'S CLEARLY GONE TO DO SOME ERRANDS OR SOMETHING, AND SEES KYLE RUNNING. SHE DRIVES PAST ME, THE LEMONADE STAND, AND THE ADULTS, AND STOPS BY KYLE AND MAKES HIM GET IN THE CAR. AND THEN, AND THIS IS THE BEST PART, SHE TAKES HIM ALL THE WAY TO CUB SCOUTS BECAUSE HE WAS WEARING HIS UNIFORM AND SHE THOUGHT HE WAS LYING WHEN HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE A MEETING!!!!!
MEANWHILE, I'M STILL BACK AT THE STAND, AND I MAKE AMENDS SOMEHOW BY SAYING THE RAFFLE IS EXTENDED UNTIL TOMORROW, AND TEAR OUT OF THERE LIKE A BAT OUT OF HELL. KYLE EVENTUALLY RETURNED HOME WITH HIS EXTREMELY ANGRY STEP-MOM, AND WE BROUGHT IN THE STAND. ALL TOLD, WE HAD USED NEARLY 30 LEMONS (MY PARENTS HAD ACTUALLY GONE TO THE GROCERY STORE TO BUY SOME MORE FOR US), AND BROUGHT IN ABOUT $1.50. 
GOOD TIMES IN AYLMER!!!!
